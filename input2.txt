(The DreamWorks Pictures SKG logo plays out, with dreamy music playing underneath. At the end of the logo, the S's in "DreamWorks" and "SKG" turn green and grow out ogre ears, matching the film's logo. Credits saying "DreamWorks Pictures Presents" and "A PDI/DreamWorks Production" appear.)

(A ray of light shines down on a leather-bound storybook. The book opens and a Scottish-accented voice narrator, named Shrek the ogre, begins reading its text)

Shrek: Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison; but none prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower. For her true love and true love's first kiss.

(Shrek chuckles and rips out a page of the book and closes it. Well, that’s okay!)

Shrek: Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of -!! (toilet flushes)

("All Star" by Smash Mouth Playing)

(We see an outhouse and hear the sound of a toilet flushing. Out steps Shrek, an ogre, who tugs at his underwear and shakes his foot of the page still stuck to his shoe. He looks lovingly at the swamp he calls home, and goes about his daily routine. Which is taking a mud shower, brushing his teeth with bugs, bathing in a muddy pond, gathering giant slugs for dinner, and painting a warning sign)

(In a nearby village, an angry mob gather up to go after Shrek. At night they gather their torches and pitchforks and enter the swamp, trampling over Shrek's warning signs. Shrek sees them after investigating the commotion, rolling his eyes. The villagers stop outside Shrek's home, unaware that Shrek is sneaking up behind them)

NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S SWAMP

Villager 1: Think it's in there?

Villager 2: All right. Let's get it!

Villager 1: Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you?

Villager 3: Yeah, it'll grind your bones for its bread.

(Shrek chuckles, revealing himself to be standing behind the mob)

Shrek: Yes, well, actually, that would be a giant.

(The mob gasps)

Shrek: Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin...

(Shrek slowly approaches as the villagers back away in fear)

Villager: No!

Shrek: They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast.

Villager 1: Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya!

(The villager waves his torch in Shrek's face. Shrek casually licks his fingers and pinches the flame, extinguishing the torch. The villager drops it)

Villager 1: Right.

(Shrek terrifies the mob with a great frightening roar, his spit extinguishing all the remaining torches. He wipes his mouth and waits for the villagers to stop shouting)

Shrek: (whispering) This is the part where you run away.

Villagers: (gasping)

(Shrek laughs as the men drop their torches and pitchforks and run away as fast they can)

Shrek: And stay out!

(He looks down and picks up a wanted poster dropped by one of the villagers. He reads it aloud)

SHREK: "Wanted. Fairytale creatures".

(He sighs and walks off. dropping the poster to the ground)

THE NEXT DAY - FOREST

Fairy tale creatures are put in chains and led into wagons by Duloc Guards. The Captain of the Duloc Guards sits at a table paying a line of people their rewards for turning in the fairytale creatures. Those waiting in line include Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Geppetto who is carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer carrying the Three Little Pigs.

Guard: All right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up!

The Captain: Next!

Guard: (Taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over! (breaks the broom in half)

The Captain: That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next!

(The captain hands over the reward to the villager who turned the witch in. The villager mutters to himself)

Villager: Lousy 20 pieces.

Guard: Get up! Come on!

(Waiting in line is Donkey on a leash and his owner. He looks in horror at the witch and a group of dwarves being loaded into a wagon)

Guard: Sit down there! Keep quiet!

Mama Bear and Papa Bear are locked inside giant cages, with Little Bear in his own cage

Little Bear: (crying) This cage is too small.

Donkey: (To his owner) Please, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance!

Old Woman: Oh, shut up. (smacks Donkey)

The Captain: Next! What have you got?

Geppetto: This little wooden puppet.

Pinocchio: I’m not a puppet, I’m a real boy. (his nose grows)

The Captain: 5 shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away.

Pinocchio: Father, please! Don't let them do this! Help me!

(Geppetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up to the table)

The Captain: Next! What have you got?

Old Woman: Well, I've got a talking donkey.

The Captain: Right. Well, that's good for 10 shillings. If you can prove it.

Old Woman: Oh, go ahead, little fella. (Donkey stays silent)

The Captain: Well?

Old Woman: Oh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. (Smacks Donkey again) Talk, you boneheaded dolt, talk!

The Captain: That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!

Old Woman: No, no, he talks! He does. (Moving Donkey's lips) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talking-est damn thing you ever saw.

The Captain: Get her out of my sight.

Old Woman: No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!

(The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled with fairy dust and starts floating upwards)

Donkey: Hey! I can fly!

Peter Pan: He can fly!

3 Little Pigs: He can fly!

The Captain: He can talk!?

Donkey: Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (The pixie dust's effects begin to wear off) Uh-oh. (He drops out of the air and hits the ground with a thud)

The Captain: Seize him!

(Donkey dodges the guards as they try to grab him and runs deeper into the forest)

Guards: After him! He's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!

(Donkey escapes deeper into the forest and runs head first into Shrek's backside. Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him and glares down at Donkey. Donkey looks scared of Shrek for a moment, but he quickly hides behind him after seeing that the guards have caught up to him)

The Captain: You there! Ogre!

Shrek: Aye?

The Captain: By the order of Lord Farquaad, I am authorized to place you both under arrest and...(Shrek slowly approaches the group of guards, the guards visibly frightened by him) transport you to... a designated...resettlement...facility?

Shrek: Oh, really? You and what army? (smiles)

(The Captain looks behind himself and sees that all the other guards have abandoned him. The Captain tucks tail and runs off. Shrek shakes his head and starts walking back to his swamp. Donkey, impressed by Shrek, follows him)

Donkey: Can I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible!

Shrek: Are you talking to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him) Whoa!

Donkey: Yes. I was talking to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back there? Man those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up and bam! They was tripping over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that.

Shrek: (annoyed) Oh, that's great. Really.

Donkey: Man, it's good to be free.

Shrek: Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm?

Donkey: But, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're a mean, green, fighting machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.

(begins to "Big Green Tractor" by Jason Aldean playing; Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before loudly roars in his face)

Donkey: Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me saying, if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tac or something, 'cause your breath stinks!

(Shrek walks off. Donkey reappears ahead of him, dangling from a felled log)

Donkey: Man, you almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk. Shrek removes his hand) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day.

Shrek: Why are you following me?

Donkey: I'll tell you why. (drops from the log. Sings) "'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, (Shrek moans) My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have friends..."

Shrek: Donkey! Donkey, no! Stop singing! (picks up Donkey by his ears and tail) Well, it's no wonder you don't have any friends! (drops him)

Donkey: Wow. Only a true friend would be that truly honest.

Shrek: Listen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I?

Donkey: (looks all the way up at Shrek, friendly hug?) Uh...really tall?

Shrek: No! I'm an ogre! You know, "Grab your torch and pitchforks!!". Doesn't that bother you?

Donkey: (shakes his head) Nope.

Shrek: (surprised) Really?

Donkey: Really, really.

Shrek: (taken aback) Oh.

Donkey: Man, I like you. What's your name?

Shrek: Uh, Shrek.

Donkey: Shrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of "I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me" thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You're all right. (they come over a hill overlooking Shrek's swamp) Woo, look at that! Who'd want to live in place like that?

Shrek: (annoyed) That would be my home.

Donkey: Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. (looks at Shrek's "keep out" signs) I guess you don't, uh, entertain much, do you?

Shrek: I like my privacy.

Donkey: You know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You're trying to give them a hint and they won't leave. And there's that big awkward silence you know? (awkward silence) Can I stay with you?

Shrek: Uh, what?

Donkey: Can I stay with you, please?

Shrek: (sarcastically) Of course!

Donkey: Really?

Shrek: No.

Donkey: Please! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (Donkey pushes Shrek up against the door) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!

Shrek: Okay. Because one night only.

Donkey: Ah! Thank you! (he runs inside the hut)

Shrek: Ah! What are you...no! (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No!

Donkey: This is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swapping manly stories, and in the morning... I'm making waffles.

Shrek: (growls in frustration)

Donkey: Where do, uh, I sleep?

Shrek: (irritated) Outside!

Donkey: Oh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door, shutting Donkey outside) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...

SHREK'S HOME - NIGHT

(Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits down, lights a candle made out of his own earwax, and begins eating. Donkey looks inside from a window, and then lays down by the front door. Shrek is about to take a bite when he hears a creaking noise. He stands up with a huff)

Shrek: (to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside!

Donkey: (from the window) I am outside!

(Shrek hears a noise from inside and turns to find the source. He sees several shadows moving and looks around. He sees the 3 Blind Mice on his table)

Mouse 1: Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have?

Mouse 2: It's not home, but it'll do just fine.

Gorder: (bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed.

Shrek: Got ya. (grabs Gorder, but he escapes and lands on his shoulder)

Gorder: I found some cheese. (bites into Shrek's ear)

Shrek: Ow! (tries to grab him)

Gorder: Blah! Awful stuff. (jumps down to the table)

Blind Mouse: Is that you, Gorder?

Gorder: How did you know?

Shrek: Enough! (he grabs all 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice) Hey!

(Shrek turns around and sees that the 7 Dwarves have put Snow White, sleeping in her glass coffin, on the table)

Shrek: Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table! (pushes the coffin away)

Dwarf: Where are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken.

Shrek: (confused) Huh?

(Shrek walks over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain. The Big Bad Wolf is laying in the bed)

Big Bad Wolf: What?

(Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging him to the front door)

Shrek: I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy?!

(He opens the front door and throws Big Bad Wolf out. He sees that a horde of fairytale creatures have set up camp in his swamp)

Shrek: Oh, no. Oh, no. No! No! (he dodges out the way of a group of witches flying on broomsticks)

(Papa Bear and Little Bear sit around the fire, the Pied Piper is playing his pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land)

Shrek: WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY SWAMP?!?!

(Shrek's voice echoes throughout the camp and everyone falls silent. Gasps are heard all around. The 3 Good Fairies hide inside a tent)

Shrek: All right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey!

Dwarves: Quickly. Come on!

(More dwarves run inside the house and shut the door behind them)

Shrek: No, no! No, no. Not there! Not there!

(Shrek fiddles with the door handle, unable to open the door. He gives Donkey an annoyed look)

Donkey: Hey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them.

Pinocchio: Well gosh, no one invited us.

Shrek: What?!

Pinocchio: We were forced to come here!

Shrek: By who?!

Little Pig: Lord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice.

Shrek: (sighs) All right. Who knows where this... "Farquaad" guy is?

(The crowd gasps at the mention of Lord Farquaad. No one answers)

Donkey: Oh, I do. I know where he is!

Shrek: Does anyone else know where to find him?

(Little Bear raises his hand but Papa Bear quickly puts his hand down. Big Bad Wolf and a wizard point at each other)

Shrek: Anyone at all?

Donkey: Me! Me!

Shrek: Anyone?

Donkey: (jumping up and down) Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me!

Shrek: (sighs) Okay, fine. Attention all...fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable! Your welcome is officially worn out! In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from!

(After a brief silence, the crowd erupts into cheering and applause. This was not Shrek's intention. A group of birds drapes a cloak made of flowers around Shrek's shoulders, much to his annoyance)

Shrek: Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're coming with me.

(Shrek brushes the cloak onto the ground, while the birds come back to place a wreath of flowers on Donkey's head. They make their through the crowd)

Donkey: All right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, 2 stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it!

Donkey: (singing) "On the road again...", sing it with me, Shrek!

(as they walk away from the crowd Shrek grabs the torch from a dwarf cheering them on, who refuses to let go. Shrek shakes the torch until the dwarf falls into a pond)

Donkey: "I can't wait to get on the road again."

Shrek: What did I say about singing? (yanks the wreath off Donkey's head)

Donkey: Can I whistle?

Shrek: No.

Donkey: Well, can I hum it?

Shrek: (annoyed) All right, hum it.

(Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. The pair walk off into the night with Shrek's torch lighting the way)

DULOC - DUNGEON

(A masked man is pouring a glass of milk. Another man is shown walking down the hallway towards a set of doors. As he is let into the room by two guards, we can see that the man is abnormally short. The masked man is dunking what looks to be a small person into the glass of milk)

Lord Farquaad: (stepping forward) That's enough. He's ready to talk.

Gingy is pulled out of the milk by Thelonious and is slammed down onto a cookie sheet. Lord Farquaad laughs evilly as he walks over to the table. When he reaches the table we see that he is too short to see above it. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.

Lord Farquaad: (he picks up the Gingy's severed legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man!

Gingy: You're a monster!

Lord Farquaad: I'm not the monster here, you are. (throws one leg at Gingy) You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world (crumbles his other leg into dust) Now, tell me! Where are the others?!

Gingy: Eat me! (spits in Lord Farquaad's left eye)

Lord Farquaad: Ugh! I've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...! (he grabs one of Gingy's gumdrop buttons)

Gingy: No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons!

Lord Farquaad: All right then. Who's hiding them?

Gingy: Okay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man?

Lord Farquaad: The muffin man?

Gingy: The muffin man.

Lord Farquaad: Yes, I know the muffin man. Who lives on Drury Lane?

Gingy: Well, she's married to the muffin man.

Lord Farquaad: (Shocked) The muffin man?

Gingy: The muffin man!

Lord Farquaad: She's married to the muffin man.

(A door opens and the Captain of the Duloc Guards steps in)

The Captain: My lord! We've found it.

Lord Farquaad: Then what are you waiting for? Bring it in!

(More guards enter carrying an object covered by a sheet. They mount it on the wall and the Captain removes the sheet. It is the Magic Mirror. Everyone stands in awe)

Gingy: Ohhhh...

Lord Farquaad: Magic mirror...

Gingy: Don't tell him anything! (Lord Farquaad smacks him off the table and into a trash can to silence him) No!

Lord Farquaad: Evening. Mirror, mirror on the wall, is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all?

Magic Mirror: Well, technically you're not a king.

Lord Farquaad: Uh, Thelonious? (Thelonious holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist as a threat to the Magic Mirror) You were saying?

Magic Mirror: What I mean is you're not a king yet. (chuckles) But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess.

Lord Farquaad: Go on.

Magic Mirror: (chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And...here they are!

(Bouncy gameshow music begins to play. Using himself as a screen, the Magic Mirror reveals three shadowy portraits of princesses. Lord Farquaad seems confused but watches on silently)

Magic Mirror: Bachelorette number 1 is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime! Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her 2 evil sisters. Please welcome...Cinderella!

(An image of Cinderella doing housework flips to a portrait of Cinderella in her ball gown putting on the glass slipper. Lord Farquaad looks at her approvingly and the Captain claps)

Magic Mirror: Bachelorette number 2 is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with 7 other men, she's not easy.

(An image of the 7 Dwarves flashes on the screen. The guards laugh at the Mirror's joke)

Magic Mirror: Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on, give it up for Snow White!

(The mirror shows a portrait of Snow White in her slumber. Lord Farquaad seems even more pleased, and everyone else claps this time)

Magic Mirror: And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number 3 is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava!

(The mirror shows an image of a giant dragon besides a tower and then of a giant castle surrounded by lava. A bright fire shines on the screen and Lord Farquaad covers his eyes. This doesn't seem to deter his interest)

Magic Mirror: But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes piña coladas and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona!

(The mirror shows a portrait of Princess Fiona leaning on the window of her tower. Once again everyone else claps)

Magic Mirror: So, will it be: bachelorette number 1, bachelorette number 2, or bachelorette number 3?

(The mirrors flips through each princesses' portrait. The guards shout out different numbers while Lord Farquaad frantically tries to decide)

Guards: 2! 2! 3! 3! 2! 2! 3!

Lord Farquaad: (to himself) 2? 3? 1? (whimpers) 3?

Thelonius: 3! (holds up 2 fingers instead of 3) Pick number 3, my lord!

Lord Farquaad: Okay, okay! Uh... number 3!

Magic Mirror: Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona.

(Wild applause erupts from the guards. Lord Farquaad is captivated by the portrait of Fiona)

Lord Farquaad: Princess...Fiona...she's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go...

Magic Mirror: But I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night.

(Lord Farquaad doesn't listen to the mirror at all, too busy formulating a plan)

Lord Farquaad: I'll do it.

Magic Mirror: Yes, but after sunset...

Lord Farquaad: Silence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and Duloc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament! (grins evilly)

DULOC KINGDOM - EXTERIOR

(Shrek and Donkey come out of the field just outside the Duloc parking lot)

Donkey: But that's it. That's it right there. That's Duloc. I told ya I'd find it.

(The 2 gaze up at Duloc Castle, a building that towers over the rest of the kingdom)

Shrek: So, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle.

Donkey: Uh-huh. That's the place.

Shrek: Do you think maybe he's compensating for something?

(Shrek laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot)

Donkey: Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.

Man: Hurry, darling. We're late. Hurry!

(A man and woman run through the castle's entrance. In front of the gate is a series of ropes hung in a maze for crowd control. A mascot wearing a giant head resembling Lord Farquaad stands at the end of the line. Shrek and Donkey exchange looks)

Shrek: Hey, you!

(The mascot screams at the sight of Shrek and begins running through the roped path to get to the front gate)

Shrek: Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just-- I just --

(Shrek sighs in frustration and then begins pushing his way through the ropes. The mascot runs into a wall and knocks himself out. Shrek pushes through the entrance's turnstile, but Donkey gets caught in it and lands on the ground with a thud. Donkey sheepishly smiles and Shrek sighs in annoyance)

DULOC - INTERIOR

(Shrek and Donkey look around the square, which is deserted. The trees and grass are neatly cut and the rows of houses all looked exactly the same. Chirpy music quietly plays from a set of loudspeakers)

Shrek: It's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody?

Donkey: Hey, look at this!

(Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin to sing)

Wooden People: (SINGING) Welcome to Duloc, such a perfect town / Here we have some rules let us lay them down / Don't make waves, stay in line and we'll get along fine / Duloc is perfect place / Please keep off of the grass / Shine your shoes, wipe your... face / Duloc is, Duloc is / Duloc is a perfect place.

(Suddenly a camera takes Shrek and Donkey's picture, both of which are dumbfounded)

Donkey: Wow! Let's do that again!

(Donkey makes ready to run over and pull the lever again but Shrek quickly grabs him by the tail)

Shrek: No! No! No, no, no! (whispers) No.

(They hear a trumpet fanfare from afar and head over to investigate. A voice sounds from the distance)

Lord Farquaad: Brave knights! You are the best and brightest in all the land, and today one of you shall prove himself better and brighter than all the rest.

(As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena, Donkey hums the Duloc theme song)

Shrek: All right, you're going the right way for a smacked bottom.

Donkey: Sorry about that.

ARENA

(In the center of a stadium-like arena, Duloc Knights are gathered as a large crowd of citizens watches on from the stands. Horses, kegs of beer, arrow targets, and other equipment are scattered about. Farquaad is atop a high up balcony, flanked by two guards, addressing the crowd. Shrek and Donkey step out onto the arena but don't seem to be noticed)

Lord Farquaad: That champion shall have the honor-- no, no -- the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place. And so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make.

(The crowd cheers and applauds. Shrek looks around, noticing a man holding up a cue card up to the crowd that reads "APPLAUSE")

Lord Farquaad: Let the tournament begin!

(Shrek marches through the Duloc Knights, who back away in disgust upon noticing him)

Lord Farquaad: Oh! What is that? It's hideous!

(The crowd gasps and goes quiet)

Shrek: Ah, that's not very nice (looks at Donkey and then back at Lord Farquaad) It's just a donkey.

(Donkey looks confused, the joke Was once again lost on him)

Lord Farquaad: Indeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have at him!

(Lord Farquaad points at Shrek. The Duloc Knights draw their weapons and slowly approach Shrek as he backs up, the crowd cheering them on)

Crowd: Get him!

Shrek: Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (He bumps into a table, noticing mugs of ale)

Crowd: Go ahead! Get him!

Shrek: (holds up a mug of ale) Can't we just settle this over a pint?

Crowd: Kill the beast!

Shrek: No? All right then. (drinks the ale in one gulp) Come on!

(Shrek takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel of ale behind him. The ale comes rushing out, knocking the knights down and wetting the ground into mud. Shrek slides past the knights and uses a spear like a hockey stick to knock one off his feet. Donkey hops up onto one of the larger beer barrels. It breaks free of its ropes and begins to roll. Donkey manages to squish 2 knights into the mud and rolls over another group of knights running after Shrek. Shrek hops over a set of ropes that appears to make up a wrestling ring. Shrek uses the ropes to launch himself at 2 knights, knocking them over with his arms. The crowd boos. Shrek jump kicks a knight, and then body slams another. A knight comes from behind Shrek with his spear ready to attack. The crowd gasps, but before he can make a move Shrek puts him in a full-nelson hold)

Donkey: Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!

(Shrek brings the knight over to Donkey, who leans on the ropes and headbutts the knight. Shrek gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd, who have now begun to cheer for Shrek and Donkey. Shrek stands on top of the ropes and beckons on the crowd's cheers)

Shrek: Yeah!

(A knight tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but he turns in time to sees him and jumps on him)

Woman: The chair! Give him the chair!

(Shrek uses a folding chair to smack the knight lying on the ground. Shrek dispatches a few more knights with ease. Shrek picks up the last knight, spinning him over his head and then throwing him against the post of the wrestling ring. Donkey kicks his helmet, and the ding sounds the end of the match. Finally all the knights are down. The audience goes wild)

Shrek: Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)

(Lord Farquaad motions to the guards, who aim their crossbows at Shrek and Donkey. The crowd gasps and goes silent. Shrek stops laughing)

Guard: Shall I give the order, sir?

Lord Farquaad: No, I have a better idea. People of Duloc! I give you our champion!

(The crowd cheers and a fanfare plays)

Shrek: What?

Lord Farquaad: Congratulations, ogre. You've won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest.

Shrek: Quest? I'm already on a quest. A quest to get my swamp back.

Lord Farquaad: Your swamp?

Shrek: Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures!

Lord Farquaad: Indeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back.

Shrek: Exactly the way it was?

Lord Farquaad: Down to the last slime-covered toadstool.

Shrek: And the squatters?

Lord Farquaad: As good as gone.

(Shrek glances at the soldiers still aiming their crossbows and then turns back to Lord Farquaad)

Shrek: What kind of quest?

VEGETABLE FIELD

(Shrek and Donkey are now walking through the fields heading away from Duloc. Shrek is munching on an onion)

Donkey: Okay, so let me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right?

Shrek: You know, maybe there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk.

Donkey: I don't get it. Why don't you just pull some of that ogre stuff on him? Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds his bones to make your bread, the whole ogre trip.

Shrek: Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have decapitated an entire village and put their heads on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and drink their fluids. Does that sound good to you?

Donkey: Uh, no, not really, no.

Shrek: For your information, there's a lot more to ogres than people think.

Donkey: Example?

Shrek: Example? Okay, um, ogres are like onions. (he holds out his onion)

Donkey: (sniffs the onion) They stink?

Shrek: Yes - - No!

Donkey: They make you cry?

Shrek: No!

Donkey: Oh, you leave them in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin' little white hairs.

Shrek: No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres have layers! Onions have layers. You get it? We both have layers. (he throws away the onion and walks off)

Donkey: (trailing after Shrek) Oh, you both have layers. Oh. {sniffs} You know, not everybody likes onions. Cake! Everybody loves cakes! Cakes have layers.

Shrek: I don't care... what everyone likes. Ogres are not like cakes. (walks passed Donkey)

Donkey: You know what else everybody likes? Parfaits. Have you ever met a person, you say, "Let's get some parfait," they say, "Hell no, I don't like no parfaits"? Parfaits are delicious.

Shrek: (Yelling) NO! You dense, irritating, miniature beast of burden! Ogres are like onions! End of story. Bye-bye. (whispers) See you later.

Donkey: Parfaits may be the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet.

Shrek: You know, I think I preferred your humming.

Donkey: Do you have a tissue or something? I'm making a mess. Just the word parfait makes me start slobbering.

(They head off. There is a montage of their journey. Walking through a field at sunset. Sleeping beneath a bright moon. Shrek burns his foot trying to stomp out the campfire, so Donkey urinates on the fire to put it out. They arrive at the outskirts of a giant volcano and begin to make their way up)

Donkey: (sniffs) Whew! Shrek! Did you do that? You gotta warn somebody before you just crack one off. My mouth was open and everything.

Shrek: Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead. (sniffs) It's brimstone. We must be getting close.

Donkey: Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking about it's the brimstone. I know what I smell. It wasn't no brimstone. It didn't come off no stone neither.

(They reach the top of the climb and hoist themselves up and over the ridge)

DRAGON'S KEEP - EXTERIOR

(Shrek and Donkey gaze out into the crater. The Dragon's Keep towered before them, a dilapidated castle, burned and blackened. Perched on a rock pinnacle, it was surrounded by a terrifying lake of molten lava. A single light shines in the window of the tallest tower. Dark clouds block out the blue sky above them. Thunder strikes and crows circling the castle can be heard. It's all very ominous)

Shrek: Sure, it's big enough, but look at the location. (laughs)

(Shrek jumps over and approaches the bridge, with Donkey joining in behind him)

Donkey: (chuckes along nervously) Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said that ogres have layers?

Shrek: Oh, aye.

Donkey: Well, I have a bit of a confession to make (gasps, seeing the skeleton of a horse). Donkeys don't have layers. We wear our fear right out there on our sleeves.

Shrek: Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves.

Donkey: You know what I mean.

Shrek: Oh, you can't tell me you're afraid of heights.

Donkey: No, I'm just a little uncomfortable about being on a rickety bridge over a boiling lake of lava!

Shrek: Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside ya, okay? For emotional support. We'll just tackle this thing together one little baby step at a time.

Donkey: Really?

Shrek: Really, really.

Donkey: Okay, that makes me feel so much better.

Shrek: Just keep moving. And don't look down.

Donkey: (nervously to himself) Okay, don't look down. Don't look down. Don't look down. Keep on moving. Don't look down.

(Donkey accidentally steps through a rotting board, which falls down into the fiery lava below)

Donkey: Shrek! I'm lookin' down! (screams) Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me off, please!

Shrek: But you're already halfway.

Donkey: But I know that half is safe!

Shrek: Okay, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back.

(Shrek tries to press on while Donkey tries to make his way back under Shrek)

Donkey: Shrek, no! Wait!

Shrek: Just, Donkey - - Let's have a dance then, shall we? (bounces and sways the bridge)

Donkey: Don't do that!

Shrek: Oh, I'm sorry. Do what? Oh, this? (bounces the bridge again)

Donkey: Yes, that!

Shrek: Yes? Yes, do it. Okay. (continues to bounce and sway as he backs Donkey across the bridge)

Donkey: No, Shrek! No! Stop it!

Shrek: You said do it! I'm doing it.

Donkey: I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die. (steps onto solid ground) Oh!

Shrek: That'll do, Donkey. That'll do. (walks towards the castle)

Donkey: Cool. So where is this fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway?

Shrek: Inside, waiting for us to rescue her. (chuckles)

Donkey: I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek.

DRAGON'S KEEP - INTERIOR

(The pair start making their way through the hallways of the dragon's dark and spooky keep. Shrek is wary, while Donkey is downright terrified. Only an occasional torch lights the way. The passages are littered with bones, armor, and weapons, presumably belonging to the many unsuccessful knights who tried to rescue the princess)

Donkey: You afraid?

Shrek: No. But...SHHHHHH. (shushes Donkey)

Donkey: Oh, good. Me neither. (Get spooked and gasps) 'Cause there's nothing wrong with being afraid. Fear's a sensible response to an unfamiliar situation. Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I might add. With a dragon that breathes fire and eats knights and breathes fire. It sure doesn't mean you're a coward if you're a little scared. I sure as heck ain't no coward. I know that.

(Donkey crashes into a pile of knight remains, knocking over a skeleton whose helmet lands on Donkey's head. The skeleton head falls off and Donkey gasps)

Shrek: Donkey, 2 things, okay? Shut. Up. Now go over there and see if you can find any stairs (grabs the helmet and puts it on)

Donkey: Stairs? I thought we was looking for the princess.

Shrek: (picking up pieces of armor) The princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest tower.

Donkey: What makes you think she'll be there?

Shrek: I read it in a book once. (walks off)

Donkey: Cool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle the stairs. I'll find those stairs. I'll whip their butt too. Those stairs won't know which way they're going.

(Shrek, now disguised as a knight in shining armor walks off further into the castle. Donkey wanders off in the opposite direction, still talking to himself, and pushes his way through a giant set of doors)

Donkey: I'm gonna take drastic steps. Kick it to the curb. Don't mess with me. I'm the stair master. I've mastered the stairs. I wish I had a step right here. I'd step all over it.

(Behind a broken wall, a giant eye opens to see an unaware Donkey. Elsewhere, Shrek spots a light in the window of a tower)

Shrek: Well, at least we know where the princess is. But where's the...

Donkey: DRAGON!!!!!!

(Donkey screams and takes off running, narrowly dodging the dragon's fiery breath. The dragon chases after Donkey, stomping on the pile of knight remains in her way. Shrek turns around to see Donkey barreling towards him with the dragon close behind him)

Shrek: Donkey, look out!

(Shrek manages to grab Donkey out of the way just as the dragon breathes another fireball. Donkey drops to the floor to avoid another fireball, which manages to singe the tuft of his tail. The dragon is just about to eat Donkey when Shrek grabs ahold of her tail)

Shrek: Got ya!

(The dragon begins to swing her tail back and forth with Shrek still holding on, then launches him into the air. Shrek crashes through the roof of the tallest tower and into Fiona's room. Fiona wakes up and looks at him lying on the floor unconscious. The dragon now focuses her attention on Donkey, breathing fire at him and forcing him onto a stone bridge. The dragon knocks down portions of the bridge until Donkey is left staying on a lone pillar)

Donkey: No. Oh, no, No! (the dragon growls) Oh, what large teeth you have! (the dragon roars) I mean white, sparkling teeth!

(The dragon pauses, looks at him inquisitively, and then smiles. Donkey might just flatter his way out of becoming dragon food)

Donkey: I know you probably hear this all time from your food, but you must bleach, 'cause that is one dazzling smile you got there. Do I detect a hint of minty freshness?

(The dragon appears to be flattered by Donkey's compliments)

Donkey: And you know what else? You know what else? You're-- You're--

(The dragon leans forward and gazes at Donkey, revealing its long eyelashes and lipsticked mouth. Suddenly it was all clear to Donkey)

Donkey: --a girl dragon! Oh, sure! I mean, of course you're a girl dragon. You're just reeking of feminine beauty.

(The dragon flutters her eyes at him)

Donkey: What's the matter with you? You got something in your eye?

(Dragon blows a heart-shaped smoke ring at Donkey)

Donkey: Ohh. Oh. Oh. Man, I'd really love to stay, but you know, I'm, uh...(coughs) I'm an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd work out if you're gonna blow smoke rings and stuff. Shrek!

(Dragon picks him up by the tail in her mouth and happily carries him off)

Donkey: No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

FIONA'S TOWER - INTERIOR

(Shrek groans as he regains consciousness. His back is to a Princess Fiona, laying upright on the bed near the window. Though a bit startled, she is ecstatic to see her knight-in-shining armor. She straightens her dress, lays back down, and then quickly reaches over for bouquet of flowers off the side table. She lays back down and pretends to be asleep, clutching the bouquet to her breast. Shrek turns, takes note of the princess and walks across the room over to her. He bends down over to Fiona and she puckers her lips. Shrek takes her by the shoulders and forcefully shakes her)

Fiona: Wha...Wha...

Shrek: Wake up!

Fiona: What?!

Shrek: Are you Princess Fiona?

Fiona: I am... (smiling) awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me.

Shrek: Ah, that's nice. Now let's go!

(Shrek turns to leave and Fiona quickly sits upright)

Fiona: But wait, Sir Knight! This be-ith our first meeting. Should it not be a wonderful, romantic moment?

(she tosses the bouquet and lays back down, swooning)

Shrek: Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time.

(Shrek walks back, yanks Fiona's arm. and hauls her out of bed and towards the door)

Fiona: Hey, wait. What are you doing? You know, you should sweep me off my feet out yonder window and down a rope onto your valiant steed.

(Shrek yanks on the door handle only for it to snap off)

Shrek: You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you?

Fiona: Mm-hmm.

(Fiona screams as Shrek suddenly smashes the door down with his shoulder, still holding onto her arm. He rushes down the tower's staircase with Fiona in tow and grabs a torch)

Fiona: But we have to savor this moment! You could recite an epic poem for me.

DRAGON'S KEEP - INTERIOR

(Shrek and Fiona cross the bridge connecting the tallest tower to the rest of the castle)

Fiona: A ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something!

(Fiona pulls her arm from Shrek's grip. They stop for a moment as Shrek figures out which direction to go)

Shrek: I don't think so.

Fiona: Well, can I at least know the name of my champion?

Shrek: Uh, Shrek.

Fiona: Sir Shrek.

(she smiles, clears her throat, and holds out a handkerchief)

Fiona: I pray that you take this favour as a token of my gratitude.

Shrek: Thanks!

(Shrek regards the handkerchief curiously and wipes his sooty face with it, blackening it. He hands it back to an appalled Fiona, but before she can react, they are startled by the dragon's roar and she drops it to the floor)

Fiona: You didn't slay the dragon?!

Shrek: It's on my to-do list, now come on!

(Shrek grabs Fiona once again and takes off running towards the direction of the dragon's roar)

Fiona: But this isn't right! You were meant to charge in, sword drawn, banner flying. That's what all the other knights did!

Shrek: Yeah, right before they burst into flames!

(He gestures at the skeleton of a knight laying against the wall, a charred outline of a man burned into the stone behind it)

Fiona: That's not the point! Ugh!

(Fiona pulls her arm free from Shrek and stops running. Shrek pauses to look around and heads for a set of wooden doors)

Fiona: Wait, where are you going? The exit's over there!

(she points her arm to her left and Shrek turns around)

Shrek: Well, I have to save my ass.

Fiona: What kind of knight are you?

Shrek: One of a kind.

THRONE ROOM

(Shrek quietly pushes open the doors, stepping out onto a balcony of large spacious room. In the center of the room, Dragon has Donkey wrapped up on her tail. Dragon sits on a floor littered with a horde of gold coins and jewels)

Donkey: Slow down. Slow down, baby, please. Look I believe it's healthy to get to know someone over a long period of time. Just, just call me old-fashioned. I don't want to rush into a... a physical relationship. I'm not...not emotionally ready for a commitment of, uh, this, uh - - "magnitude" really is the word I'm looking for. Magnitude.

(Dragon gently caresses Donkey with a single claw)

Donkey: Hey, that is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what are you doing?

(Dragon looks up at the chandelier hanging above them and gently lights its candles with her fire breath)

Donkey: Okay, okay. Let's just back up a little and take this one step at a time. I mean we really should get to know each other first, you know, as friends or maybe even pen pals. Y'know cause I'm on the road a lot, but I just love receiving cards to read --

(Shrek jumps off the balcony, grabbing a chain connected to the chandelier. The chain does not hang low enough for him to be able to grab Donkey and he swings over Dragon. The chain swings back and he is left dangling above her)

Donkey: Oh y'know I'd, I'd really love to stay, but -- (Dragon tugs at Donkey's tail with her mouth)

Donkey: Hey. hey don't do that! That's my tail! That's my personal tail. You're gonna tear it off. I don't give permission to-- hey! What are you gonna do with that?

(Dragon purses her lips and gets ready to kiss Donkey. Shrek looks up and spots that the chain is jammed above him. He starts shaking it to try and relapse it from the pulley. Suddenly the pulley comes loose and Shrek starts falling)

Donkey: Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No. No, no, no. No! Oh!

(Shrek lands on Donkey and bumps him out of Dragon's grasp just as she is about to kiss him, and she instead kisses Shrek's butt. She opens her eyes and roars. Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto her head, which acts as a collar around her neck. She roars again and Shrek and Donkey take off running. They dodge a blast of fire from Dragon. Shrek grabs Donkey in one arm and then grabs Princess Fiona, who has wandered into the room, with the other arm as he runs past her)

Donkey: Hi, Princess!

Fiona: It talks!

Shrek: Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's the trick.

(They all gasp as Shrek suddenly stops, having reached the end of the balcony Shrek spots a fallen column that has formed a sort of slide. He jumps on it just as Dragon tries to bite them and slides down it. Unfortunately there is a crack in the stone and it hits Shrek right in the crotch. His eyes cross and as he reaches the bottom of the slide, he groans and stumbles off. Dragon chases after them, the chain of the chandelier still unraveling. They are chased by Dragon through a large hall, her chain looping itself around multiple stone pillars as Shrek zigzags around them. Dragon ends up in front of them and breathes fire. Shrek dodges the fire and runs away, leaping over several rows of chains. He comes to a halt)

Shrek: Okay, you 2, head for the exit! (setting down Donkey and Fiona) I'll take care of the dragon.

(Shrek grabs a sword lodged in the floor and sticks it through a link in the chain and deep into the floor. Shrek catches up with Donkey and Fiona, who are waiting near the exit)

Shrek: Run!

(They sprint as fast as they can out of the castle and onto the rickety bridge as Dragon breathes a huge fireball behind them. As they reach the middle of the bridge the fire burns the bridge and it snaps in half. They hang onto the bridge as they are swung to the other side. Donkey, unable to grab on, falls off but Shrek catches him by the leg. Fiona screams in horror as Dragon flies over the boiling lava to get them. Suddenly the chandelier pulls Dragon back, the sword having lodged itself into a stone column and getting the chain stuck. The group quickly climbs up to safety. Dragon lets out a defeated roar, then gives a sad whimper)

VOLCANO - EXTERIOR

(The first to climb out, Fiona gracefully slides down to the bottom of the volcano hill)

Fiona: You did it! You rescued me! You're amazing.

Behind her Donkey tumbles his way down the hill.

Fiona: You're -- you're wonderful. You're...

(she turns to see Shrek slide down the hill and crash into Donkey)

Fiona: A little unorthodox I'll admit. But...thy deed is great, and thine heart is pure. I am eternally in your debt.

Donkey: Ahem...

Fiona: And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed?

(she reaches down, squeezing Donkey's face)

Donkey: I hope you heard that. She called me a noble steed. She thinks I'm a steed.

(Donkey blushes, causing Fiona to chuckle and Shrek to roll his eyes)

Fiona: The battle is won. You may remove your helmet, good Sir Knight.

(Donkey gasps and makes eye contact with Shrek)

Shrek: Uh, no.

Fiona: Why not?

Shrek: I...I have helmet hair.

Fiona: Please. I would'st look upon the face of my rescuer.

Shrek: Oh, no, you wouldn't -- st.

Fiona: But, how will you kiss me?

Shrek: What?

(Shrek backs away and bumps into a wall)

Shrek: (to Donkey) That wasn't in the job description.

Donkey: Maybe it's a perk! (suggestively raises his eyebrows)

Fiona: No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know how it goes: A princess locked in a tower and beset by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight, and then they share true love's first kiss.

(They both give Fiona a wide-eyed look)

Donkey: Hmm? With Shrek? You think --who, whoa, wait a sec. You think that Shrek is your true love?

Fiona: Well... yes.

(Fiona sheepishly smiles at Shrek. Shrek and Donkey turn to each other and burst out laughing)

Donkey: You think Shrek is your true love!

Fiona: (annoyed) What is so funny?

Shrek: Let's just say I'm not your type, okay?

Fiona: Of course, you are. You're my rescuer. Now--now remove your helmet.

Shrek: Look. I really don't think this is a good idea.

Fiona: Just take off the helmet.

Shrek: I'm not going to.

Fiona: Take it off.

Shrek: No!

Fiona: NOW!

Shrek: OKAY! Easy! As you command, Your Highness.

(Shrek shakes his head and takes off his helmet and reveals his ogre self. Fiona looks at him blankly, confused but not frightened. Shrek awkwardly grins)

Fiona: You're...an ogre.

Shrek: Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming?

Fiona: Well --yes, actually! Oh, no. This is all wrong. You're not supposed to be an ogre! (walks off)

Shrek : (sighs) Princess, I was sent to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay? He's the one who wants to marry you.

(the mention of this Lord Farquaad prompts Fiona to turn around in surprise)

Fiona: Well then why didn't he come rescue me?

Shrek: Good question. You should ask him that when we get there.

(Shrek turns and mocks Fiona while removing what little armor is still left attached to him)

Fiona: But I have to be rescued by my true love! Not by some ogre and hi...hi...his pet.

Donkey: Well, so much for a noble steed.

Shrek: Look, princess, you're not making my job any easier.

Fiona: Well, I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem. You can tell Lord "Farquaad" that if he wants to rescue me properly, I'll be waiting for him right here.

(Fiona sits down determinedly on a nearby rock)

Shrek: Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all right? (Advancing toward her) I'm a delivery boy.

Fiona: You wouldn't dare.

(Shrek picks Fiona up and puts her over his shoulder)

Fiona: (screams) Put me down!

Shrek: You coming, Donkey?

Donkey: Oh, yep! I'm right behind ya.

(Fiona is now kicking and screaming)

Fiona: Put me down or you will suffer the consequences! This is not dignified! Put me down!

(Fiona smacks Shrek on the back of the head and screams in frustration)

WOODS

(Hours have passed and Fiona has calmed down. She hangs limply while Shrek carries her and Donkey walks behind them)

Donkey: Okay, so here's another question. Say there's a woman that digs you, right, but you don't really like her that way. How do you let her down real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't get burned to a crisp and eaten? How do you do that?

Fiona: You just tell her she's not your true love. Everyone knows what happens when you find your...

(Shrek cuts her off with a deliberate, bouncing readjustment)

Fiona: Hey! The sooner we get to Duloc the better.

Donkey: Oh you're gonna love it there, Princess. It's beautiful!

Fiona: And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad? What's he like?

Shrek: Well, let me put it this way, princess.

(Shrek dumps Fiona to the ground unceremoniously and heads to a nearby pond to wash up)

Shrek: Men of Farquaad's stature are in..."short" supply.

(he chuckles and Donkey joins in)

Donkey: I don't know, Shrek. There are those who think..."little" of him.

(They laugh even harder)

Fiona: Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You're just jealous that you can never measure up to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.

Shrek: Yeah, well, maybe you're right, princess. But I'll let you do the..."measuring"...when you see him tomorrow.

Fiona: Tomorrow?

(Panic-stricken, Fiona looks back fearfully at the setting sun)

Fiona: It'll take that long? Shouldn't we stop to make camp?

Shrek: No, that'll take longer. We can keep going.

Fiona: But there's....robbers in the woods.

Donkey: Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camp is definitely starting to sound good.

Shrek: Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything we're going to see in this forest.

(Fiona jumps in front of Shrek, blocking him)

Fiona: I NEED TO FIND SOMEWHERE TO CAMP NOW!!

(Both Shrek and Donkey's ears lower, taken aback by her outburst)

CLIFFSIDE

(A few minutes later, Shrek is rolling a large boulder away from the mouth of a cave)

Shrek: Hey! Over here!

Donkey: Shrek, we can do better than that. I don't think this is fit for a princess.

(Fiona turns her attention away from the setting sun)

Fiona: No, no, it's perfect. It just needs a few homey touches.

Shrek: Homey touches? Like what?

(He hears a huge ripping sound and looks over at Fiona, who has torn the bark off of a tree with her bare hands)

Fiona: A door. Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night.

(She enters the cave and puts the bark door up behind her)

Donkey: You want me to come in there and read you a bedtime story? 'Cause I will.

Fiona: I said good night!

(Shrek looks at Donkey for a second and then reaches to move the boulder back in front of the entrance)

Donkey: Shrek, what are you doing?!

Shrek: (laughs) I just--you know - - Oh, come on. I was just kidding.

CLIFFSIDE - NIGHT

(Later that night Shrek and Donkey are sitting around a campfire. They gaze up into the sky as Shrek points out certain star constellations to Donkey)

Shrek: And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, the only ogre to ever spit over three wheat fields.

Donkey: Right. Yeah. Hey, can you tell my future from these stars?

Shrek: The stars don't tell the future, Donkey. They tell stories. Look, there's Bloodnut the Flatulent. You can guess what he's famous for. (chuckles)

Donkey: Alright now I know you're making this up.

Shrek: No, look.

(Shrek traces the constellation with his finger)

Shrek: There he is, and there's the group of hunters running away from his stench.

Donkey: Man, that ain't nothing but a bunch of little dots.

Shrek: You know, Donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear. Hmm?

(Shrek glances over to see if Donkey understands him, but is met with a blank look)

Shrek: Forget it.

Donkey: Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?

Shrek: Our swamp?

Donkey: You know, when we're through rescuing the princess and all that stuff.

Shrek: We? Donkey, there's no we. There's no our. There's just me and my swamp. And the first thing I'm gonna do is build a ten-foot wall around my land.

(He turns his back on Donkey)

Donkey: You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real deep just now.

(Donkey walks over to face Shrek)

Donkey: You know what I think? I think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody out.

Shrek: No, do ya think?

(Shrek turns away again)

Donkey: Are you hidin' something?

Shrek: Never mind, Donkey.

(He lies on his back. Donkey leans over him)

Donkey: Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it?

Shrek: No, this is one of those "drop it and leave it alone" things!

Donkey: Why don't you want to talk about it?

Shrek: Why do you want to talk about it? (turns)

Donkey: Why are you blocking?

Shrek: I'm not blocking! (turns)

Donkey: Oh, yes, you are.

Shrek: Donkey, I'm warning you...

Donkey: Who you trying to keep out?

(Shrek gets on his feet and faces Donkey)

Shrek: Everyone! Okay?!

Donkey: Oh, now we're getting somewhere.

(Unseen by either of them, Fiona was peeking around the cave door, eavesdropping on the conversation)

Shrek: Oh! For the love of Pete!

(Shrek walks over to the edge of the cliff and sits down)

Donkey: Hey what's your problem Shrek? What you got against the whole world anyway, huh?

Shrek: Look, I'm not the one with the problem, okay? It's the world that seems to have a problem with me. People take one look at me and go "Aah! Help! Run! A big, stupid, ugly ogre!" They judge me before they even know me. That's why I'm better off alone.

(Hidden in the shadows of the cave, Fiona's eyes were sympathetic. She closes the door. Donkey stares silently at Shrek for a moment and then sits down beside him)

Donkey: You know what? When we met, I didn't think you was just a big, stupid, ugly ogre.

Shrek: Yeah, I know.

Donkey: So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?

Shrek: Well, there's, um, Gabby...the Small...and Annoying.

Donkey: Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny one, right there. That one there?

Shrek: That's the moon.

Donkey: Oh, okay.

DULOC - LORD FARQUAAD'S BEDROOM

(Lord Farquaad's room is is filled with items prepared for his wedding, including crowns and wedding outfits for him and Fiona. Mama Bear is now a taxidermized rug. Soft music plays in the background. Lord Farquaad lays in bed with the Magic Mirror set up at the foot of the bed)

Lord Farquaad: Again, show me again.

We hear the sound of tape rewinding.

Lord Farquaad: Mirror, mirror, show her to me. Show me the princess.

Magic Mirror: (uncomfortably) Hmm.

(The Mirror reluctantly rewinds and begins to play again from the beginning, displaying the image of Fiona waiting in her tower)

Lord Farquaad: Ah...perfect.

Lord Farquaad looks down and pulls the sheet up to cover himself as the covers rise.

CLIFFSIDE - MORNING

(Fiona walks out of the cave and glances at Shrek and Donkey who are still sleeping. She wanders off into the woods, marveling at the nature, and begins to sing. A bluebird flies over to join in her song. She hits higher and higher notes and the bird struggles to keep up with her. Fiona hits a high, horrible note that causes the bird to explode. Fiona looks guilty, but she eyes the eggs that the bird left behind. A little later, Fiona is now frying the eggs over the campfire using a rock skillet. Shrek wakes up, smells the food, and takes note of Fiona. Donkey is talking to himself in his sleep)

Donkey: Mmm, yeah, you know I like it like that. Come on, baby. I said I like it...

Shrek: Donkey, wake up. (shakes him)

Donkey: Huh? What?

Shrek: Wake up.

Donkey: What? (stretches and yawns)

Fiona: Good morning. Uhmm... how do you like your eggs?

Donkey: Oh, good morning, Princess!

Shrek: What's all this about?

Fiona: You know, we kind of got off to a bad start yesterday and I wanted to make it up to you. I mean, after all, you did rescue me.

(Fiona gets up and sets the eggs down in front of them)

Shrek: Uh, thanks.

(Donkey sniffs the eggs and licks his lips)

Fiona: Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead of us.

(Fiona walks off, seemingly in a better mood than yesterday. Shrek and Donkey look at each other)

SHERWOOD FOREST

(The 3 continue their journey back to Duloc though the woods. Shrek lets out a loud belch)

Donkey: Shrek!

Shrek: What? It's a compliment. Better out than in, I always say. (laughs)

Donkey: Well, it's no way to behave in front of a princess!

(Fiona belches, stopping Shrek and Donkey in their tracks)

Fiona: Thanks.

Donkey: She's as nasty as you are.

Shrek: (chuckles) You know, you're not exactly what I expected.

Fiona: Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them.

(She smiles and then continues walking, singing softly. Suddenly from out of nowhere, a man swings down and swoops Fiona away)

Monsieur Hood: La liberte! Hey!

SHREK: Princess!

(Fiona and the unknown man land on a limb high above in the trees. It is none other than Monsieur Hood, also known as Robin Hood. Fiona breaks away from Monsieur Hood, who has his hand around her waist)

Fiona: Oh! Wait wait--what are you doing?!

Monsieur Hood: Be still, mon cherie, for I am you savior! And I am rescuing you from this green...

(Monsieur Hood brings Fiona's hand to his chest, and then carpets Fiona's arms with kisses as she pulls back in disgust)

Monsieur Hood: ...beast.

(His smile is only met with annoyance, which confuses him)

Shrek: Hey! That's my princess! Go find you own!

Monsieur Hood: Please, monster! Can't you see I'm a little busy here?

(Fiona gives Monsieur Hood a one-handed push and jams her finger into his chest)

Fiona: Look, pal, I don't know who you think you are!

Monsieur Hood: Oh! Of course! Oh, how rude. Please let me introduce myself.

He cups his hand and calls into the woods

Monsieur Hood: Oh, Merry Men! (laughs)

(Suddenly an accordion begins to play and the Merrymen pop out from the bushes. They begin to sing along with Monsieur Hood)

Merrymen: Ta, dah, dah, dah, whoo.

Monsieur Hood: I steal from the rich and give to the needy.

Merryman: He takes a wee percentage,

Monsieur Hood: But I'm not greedy. I rescue pretty damsels, man, I'm good.

Merrymen: What a guy, Monsieur Hood.

Monsieur Hood: Break it down. I like an honest fight and a saucy little maid...

Merrymen: What he's basically saying is he likes to get...

Monsieur Hood: Paid! So...When an ogre in the bush grabs a lady by the tush. That's bad.

Merrymen: That's bad. That's bad. That's bad!

Monsieur Hood: When a beauty's with a beast it makes me awfully mad!

Merrymen: He's mad, he's really, really mad!

(Fiona, still up in the tree, looks down. Her expression changes from confusion to horror as Monsieur Hood sings the last line)

Monsieur Hood: I'll take my blade and ram it through your heart, keep your eyes on me, boys 'cause I'm about to start...

(Fiona swings down from the tree limb and kicks Monsieur Hood in the head, knocking him unconscious. She lands with a back flip in front of Shrek and Donkey)

Fiona: Man, that was annoying!

(Shrek looks at her in admiration)

Merryman: Oh, you little--

(The Merry Man shoots an arrow at Fiona but she ducks out of the way. The arrow flies past her and towards Donkey, who jumps into Shrek's arms to get out of the way. Fiona demonstrates her martial arts skills and easily defeats up every last Merryman. The Merrymen are left on lying on the ground and Fiona walks away. Fiona looks a little embarrassed as she smoothes out her dress and regains her composure)

Fiona: Uh, shall we?

Shrek: Hold the phone.

(Taken aback, Shrek drops Donkey and begins walking after Fiona)

Shrek: Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on now. Where did that come from?

Fiona: What?

Shrek: That! Back there. That was amazing! Where did you learn that?

(Fiona blushes)

FIONA: Well...(laughs) when one lives alone, uh, one has to learn these things in case there's a...there's an arrow in your butt!

(Fiona points downwards at a small arrow jutting out of Shrek's butt)

Shrek: What? Oh, would you look at that?

Fiona: Oh, no. This is all my fault. I'm so sorry.

(Shrek lightly tugs at the arrow but stops, wincing in pain. Donkey catches up to them)

Donkey: Why? What's wrong?

Fiona: Shrek's hurt.

Donkey: Shrek's hurt! Shrek's hurt?!

(Donkey frantically begins to scamper around)

Donkey: Oh, no, Shrek's gonna die!

Shrek: Donkey, I'm okay.

Donkey: You can't do this to me, Shrek. I'm too young for you to die! Keep your legs elevated! Turn your head and cough! Does anyone know the Heimlich?!

(Fiona grabs Donkey's head and pulls it down to her)

Fiona: Donkey! Calm down! If you want to help Shrek, run into the woods and find me a blue flower with red thorns.

Donkey: Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I'm on it. Blue flower, red thorns. Don't die Shrek.

(Donkey begins to head in a random direction into the forest.)

Donkey: And if you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light!

Shrek and Fiona: Donkey!

Donkey: Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns...

(Donkey marches off, still chanting, until he is out of earshot)

Shrek: What are the flowers for?

Fiona: For getting rid of Donkey.

Shrek: Ah...

(Shrek's confused look turns into a big grin)

Fiona: Now you hold still, and I'll yank this thing out.

Fiona grabs hold of the arrow and begins to pull. Shrek winces and jumps away.

Shrek: Ow! Hey! Easy with the yanking!

Fiona: Well, I'm sorry, but it has to come out.

Shrek: No, it's tender.

(As they continue to talk Fiona keeps grabbing after the arrow as Shrek dodges her attempts)

Fiona: Now, hold still.

Shrek: What you're doing is the opposite of help.

Fiona: Don't move.

Shrek: Look, time out.

(Shrek puts his entire hand over Fiona's face, stopping her in her tracks)

Fiona: Would you...

(She takes Shrek's hand off her face)

Fiona: Okay. What do you propose we do?

SHERWOOD FOREST - ELSEWHERE

(Deeper in the woods, Donkey is hurriedly searching for the flower)

Donkey: Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. This would be so much easier if I wasn't color-blind! Blue flower, red thorns.

(Suddenly he hears a far out yell from Shrek)

Shrek: Owww!

Donkey: Hold on, Shrek! I'm coming!

(Donkey rips a flower off a nearby bush, which happens to be a blue flower with red thorns, and takes off running)

SHERWOOD FOREST - CLEARING

(Back in the clearing, Shrek is laying on the ground facedown, while Fiona stands over him, using both hands to try to remove the arrow)

Shrek: Ow! Not good.

Fiona: Okay. N--Okay. I can nearly see it...It's just about...

Shrek: Ow! Ohh!

(He rolls over, knocking Fiona off her feet and causing her to land on top of him. For a moment they stare into each other's eyes)

Donkey: Ahem.

(They are both startled by Donkey's interruption. Donkey, with the flower dropped at his feet, gives them a suggestive look)

Shrek: Nothing happened.

(Shrek pushes Fiona off him and rolls over to face Donkey)

Shrek: We were just, uh...

Donkey: Look, if you wanted to be alone, all you had to do was ask, okay?

Shrek: Oh, come on! That's the last thing on my mind. The princess here was just--

(Fiona quickly pulls the arrow out of Shrek's butt with one great pull)

SHREK: Uggghhh!

(He turns to look at Fiona, who playfully shakes the arrow back and forth with a coy smile)

Shrek: Ow!

Donkey: Hey, what's that? (chuckling) That's...is that blood?

(Donkey faints and falls into a pile of leaves. Shrek picks him up and throws him over his shoulder, and the three continue on their journey. There is a montage of scenes as the group heads back to Duloc)

(The group comes to a river with no path across, though it is clearly shallow enough to walk over. Shrek climbs to the top of a tree, using his weight to cause the tree to bend over the river and form a bridge. Fiona crosses first and lays a hand on Shrek's back when she gets to the other side. Shrek grins and gets up while Donkey is still crossing, launching him back to the other side. In a field, Shrek swats away at a swarm of flies following him. Fiona grabs a nearby spiderweb from a tree branch and runs through the field, swinging it around to catch the bugs. She spins the branch to form a sort of cotton candy, and hands it to Shrek as a treat. As he walks off biting it, she licks her fingers. Shrek catches a frog and blows it up like a balloon to give to Fiona. Fiona catches a snake, blows into its mouth, fashions it into a balloon animal and presents it to Shrek. Fiona starts a playful shoving match with Shrek, with Shrek ultimately flinging her into the bushes. She throws a twig at him as they both laugh, letting go of their balloons. Donkey jumps after them)

WINDMILL - EXTERIOR

(After breaking out of the forest, the group arrives onto a small rise where an old, ruined windmill stands. The fields of Duloc stretch out before before, and further in the distance stands the Duloc Castle)

Shrek: There it is, princess. Your future awaits you.

Fiona: That's Duloc?

(Fiona stands with her arm on Shrek's, but Donkey butts in-between them. They both shrug at each other)

Donkey: Yeah, I know. You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's compensating for something, which I think means he has a really...

(Shrek interrupts Donkey by stepping on his foot, causing him to fall to the ground in pain. Fiona gives Shrek a suspicious look)

Donkey: Oww!

Shrek: Um, I, uh-- I guess we better move on.

Fiona: Sure. But, Shrek? I'm-- I'm worried about Donkey.

Shrek: What?

Fiona: I mean, look at him. He, he doesn't look so good.

(Nothing seems to be wrong with Donkey. Shrek smiles knowingly at Fiona)

Donkey: What are you talking about? I'm fine.

(Fiona kneels down and takes Donkey's head in her arms)

Fiona: Well that's what they always say and then...then...then the next thing you know, you're on your back. Dead.

Shrek: You know, she's right. You look awful. Do you want to sit down?

Fiona: Uh, you know, I'll make you some tea.

Donkey: I didn't want to say nothing, but I got this twinge in my neck, and when I turn my head like this, look.

(Donkey sharply leans his head to the side, letting out a loud crack)

Donkey: Ow! See?

(Shrek and Fiona give each happy looks, having made up an excuse to stall for time)

Shrek: Who's hungry? I'll find us some dinner.

Fiona: I'll get the firewood.

(Shrek and Fiona both walk off in separate directions)

Donkey: Hey, where you going? Oh, man, I can't feel my toes! (looks down) I don't have any toes! I think I need a hug.

WINDMILL - EXTERIOR - EVENING

Shrek has built a fire and is cooking something on a spit while Fiona eats.

Fiona: Mmm. This is good. This is really good. What is this?

Shrek: Uh, weed rat. Rotisserie style.

Fiona: No kidding. Well, this is delicious.

Shrek: Well, they're also great in stews. Now, I don't mean to brag, but I make a mean weed rat stew.

(Fiona smiles, but it quickly fades as she looks off at Duloc in the distance)

Fiona: I guess I'll be dining a little differently tomorrow night.

Shrek: Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp sometime. I'll cook all kind of stuff for you. Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare -- you name it.

(Fiona is now intently looking at Shrek, smiling)

Fiona: Hmmm, I'd like that.

(They gaze into each other's eyes longingly)

Shrek: Um...princess?

FIONA: Yes...Shrek?

Shrek: I, um, I was wondering...are you...(sighs) Are you gonna eat that?

(Shrek points to her last piece of food. Fiona, expecting a different question, removes the weedrat while Shrek is annoyed by the words that couldn't come out. Fiona hands it to Shrek and he grabs onto her hand. The two slowly lean towards each other. Donkey interrupts the moment)

Donkey: Man, isn't this romantic? Just look at that sunset.

(Shrek and Fiona are both startled out of their moment. Fiona's mood changes and she sits up to abruptly face the sunset)

Fiona: Sunset?! Oh, no! I mean, it's late. I-It's very late.

(She begins backing up toward the windmill)

Shrek: What?

Donkey: Wait a minute. I see what's going on here.

(Fiona looks at Donkey and freezes with panic)

Donkey: You're afraid of the dark, aren't you?

Fiona: Yes! Yes, that's it. I'm terrified. You know, I'd better go inside.

(She smiles as she turns around to walk up the windmill's steps. She breathes a sigh of relief)

Donkey: Don't feel bad, Princess. I used to be afraid of the dark, too, until -- Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of the dark.

(Shrek groans and Fiona chuckles)

Fiona: Good night.

Shrek: Good night.

(Fiona goes inside the windmill, gives Shrek a look, and closes the door. Donkey looks at Shrek with a new eye)

Donkey: Ohh! Now I really see what's going on here.

Shrek: Oh, what are you talkin' about?'

(Donkey trots over to Shrek as he kneels by the fire and fiddles with one of the spits)

Donkey: I don't even wanna hear it. Look, I'm an animal, and I got instincts. And I know you two were diggin' on each other. I could feel it.

Shrek: You're crazy. I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad.

Donkey: Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell the pheromones. Just go on in and tell her how you feel.

Shrek: I--there's nothing to tell. Besides, even if I did tell her that, well, you know-- and I'm not sayin' I do, 'cause I don't -- she's a princess, and I'm...

Donkey: An ogre?

Shrek: Yeah. An ogre.

(Shrek tosses the spit aside and trudges away)

Donkey: Hey, where you going?

Shrek: To get...more firewood.

(Donkey looks suspiciously over at the large pile of firewood already piled up. Shrek sits on the hill and gazes out at Duloc until nightfall)

WINDMILL - EXTERIOR - NIGHT

(Donkey opens the door to the windmill and steps in. The abandoned windmill is filed with shadows and cobwebs. All is quiet and Fiona is nowhere to be seen)

Donkey: Princess? Princess Fiona? Princess, where are you?

A group of birds flocks out the top of the roof, startling Donkey. He continues on.

Donkey: Princess?

(A hand grips the rungs of a ladder)

Donkey: It's very spooky in here. I ain't playing no games.

(Fiona looks at Donkey, cloaked in shadows, from up above on a platform. She tries to sneak away, but a wood plank breaks and she falls down with a crash. She screams and lands on a sack of flour, launching a cloud of flour into the air. Donkey is frozen with fear, unable to tell who the figure is)

Donkey: Aah!

Fiona: Oh, no!

Donkey: No, No, help!

Fiona: Shh!

(An ogress emerges from the cloud of flour, approaching Donkey)

Donkey: Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

Fiona: No, it's okay! It's okay!

Donkey: What did you do with the princess?!

Fiona: Donkey, shh! I'm the princess.

Donkey: Aah!

Fiona: It's me, in this body.

Donkey: Oh, my God! You ate the princess! (to her stomach) Can you hear me?

Fiona: Donkey!

Donkey: (still aimed at her stomach) Listen, keep breathing! I'll get you out of there!

Fiona: No!

Donkey: Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

Fiona: (Covering Donkey's mouth) Shh.

Donkey: (Muffled) Shrek!

Fiona: This is me.

(Donkey looks into her eyes as she pets his muzzle, and he calms down)

Donkey: Princess...? What happened to you? You're, uh...uh...eh...different.

Fiona: I'm ugly, okay?

Donkey: Well, yeah! Well was it something you ate? 'Cause I told Shrek those rats was a bad idea. You are what you eat, I said. Now--

Fiona: No! I -- I've been this way as long as I can remember.

Donkey: What do you mean? Look, I ain't never seen you like this before.

Fiona: It only happens when sun goes down.

(Fiona leans over a barrel filled with water, looking at her reflection)

Fiona: "By night one way, by day another. This shall be the norm... until you find true love's first kiss... and then take love's true form."

Donkey: Aww, that's beautiful. I didn't know you wrote poetry.

Fiona: It's a spell. (sigh) When I was a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me. Every night I become this. This horrible, ugly beast!

(Fiona smacks her reflection in the water, which splashes water onto Donkey)

Fiona: I was placed in a tower to await the day my true love would rescue me. That's why I have to marry Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun sets and he sees me...like this.

(She holds her head and begins to cry)

Donkey: All right, all right. Calm down. Look, it's not that bad. You're not that ugly. Well, ok, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly. But you only look like this at night. Shrek's ugly 24/7.

Fiona: But Donkey, I'm a princess, and this is not how a princess is meant to look.

Donkey: Princess, how 'bout if you don't marry Farquaad?

Fiona: I have to. Only my true love's kiss can break the spell.

Donkey: But, you know, um...you're kind of an ogre. And Shrek...well...you got a lot in common.

Fiona: Shrek?

WINDMILL EXTERIOR

(Shrek is walking towards the windmill with a sunflower in his hand, talking to himself)

Shrek: Princess, I-- Uh, how's it going, first of all? Good? Um, good for me too. I'm okay. I saw this flower and thought of you because it's pretty and-- well, I don't really like it but I thought you might like it 'cause you're pretty. But I like you anyway. I'd-- uh, uh...(sighs) I'm in trouble. Okay, here we go.

(He walks up to the door and pauses outside when he hears Donkey and Fiona talking)

Fiona: I can't just marry whoever I want. Take a good look at me, Donkey. I mean, really, who could ever love a beast so hideous and ugly? "Princess" and "ugly" don't go together. That's why I can't stay here with Shrek.

(Shrek steps back in shock, misunderstanding the conversation's meaning)

Fiona: My only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love. Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how it has to be.

(Shrek heaves a deep sigh. He throws the flower down and walks away angrily)

WINDMILL INTERIOR

Fiona: It's the only way to break the spell.

Donkey: Well you at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.

(Donkey walks over to the door)

Fiona: No! You can't breathe a word. No one must ever know.

Donkey: What's the point of being able to talk if you gotta keep secrets?

Fiona: Promise you won't tell. Promise!

Donkey: All right, all right. I won't tell him. But you should.

(Donkey steps outside and talks to himself)

Donkey: I just know before this is over, I'm gonna need a whole lot of serious therapy. Look at my eye twitching.

(Fiona opens the door and watches him walk away. She looks down and spots the sunflower left by the door. She picks it up and looks around, then heads back inside and closes the door. Donkey falls asleep by the fire outside)

WINDMILL INTERIOR - MORNING

(Donkey is asleep. Fiona is still awake, plucking at petals from the sunflower)

Fiona: I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him, I tell him not...

(Fiona picks the last petal off the sunflower, smiling)

Fiona: I tell him! Shrek!

(She opens the door and steps outside)

Fiona: Shrek! There's something I want...

(Fiona looks around for Shrek only to see Donkey sleeping. She sees the rising sun, and as the sun crests the sky, she turns back into a human. She looks up again to see Shrek stomping towards her. She hurries over to him)

Fiona: Shrek! Are you all right?

(She puts her hand on his arm, but he nudges it away and walks past her)

Shrek: (Sarcastically) Perfect! Never been better.

Fiona: I...I don't...there's something I have to tell you.

Shrek: You don't have to tell me anything, princess. I heard enough last night.

Fiona: You heard what I said?

Shrek: Every word.

(Shrek sits down on the steps of the windmill and faces Fiona)

Fiona: I thought you'd understand.

Shrek: Oh, I understand. Like you said, "Who could love a hideous, ugly beast?"

Fiona: But I thought that wouldn't matter to you.

Shrek: Yeah? Well, it does.

(Fiona looks at him in shock, tears welling in her eyes. Shrek looks past her and spots a group approaching)

Shrek: Ah, right on time. Princess, I've brought you a little something.

(Shrek gestures towards the group and Fiona stands with her mouth wide. Lord Farquaad arrives on horseback, appearing taller than usual, along with an escort of guards. Donkey wakes up with a yawn as the guards march by)

Donkey: What'd I miss? What'd I miss?

(One of the guards looms over him and he begins to scurry away, muttering to himself)

Donkey: Who said that? Couldn't have been a donkey.

(Lord Farquaad stops his horse in front of Fiona)

Lord Farquaad: Princess Fiona.

Shrek: As promised. Now hand it over.

Lord Farquaad: Very well, ogre. The deed to your swamp, cleared out, as agreed. Take it and go before I change my mind.

(Shrek snatches the deed out of the hands of a guard and walks away. Fiona is put off by this exchange. She reverts her attention back to the long-awaited Lord Farquaad)

Lord Farquaad: Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but you startled me--for I have never seen such a radiant beauty before. I am Lord Farquaad.

Fiona: Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no. Forgive me, my lord, for I was just saying a short...

(Lord Farquaad snaps his finger and is lifted off his horse by his guards. Left behind on the horse is a large set of gauntlets and a pair of leg extenders that reached down to the stirrups, which made him look so tall on the saddle. and set down in front of her. Standing at the height of four and a half feet, he is much shorter than Fiona. Her look turns from nervousness to bemusement, and she awkwardly smiles)

Fiona: ...farewell.

Lord Farquaad: Oh, that is so sweet. You don't have to waste good manners on the ogre. It's not like it has feelings.

Fiona: No, you're right. It doesn't.

(Shrek, still standing nearby with his back turned, is hurt by the comment. Donkey watches this exchange with a curious look on his face)

Lord Farquaad: Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawless Fiona. I ask your hand in marriage.

(Lord Farquaad gets down on one knee and takes Fiona's hand, pulling her down sharply)

Lord Farquaad: Will you be the perfect bride for the perfect groom?

(Fiona makes eye contact with Shrek before he turns away. Her sad look turns to bitterness)

Fiona: Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would make--

Lord Farquaad: Excellent! I'll start the plans, for tomorrow we wed!

Fiona: No!

(Shrek spins back around with a hopeful look on his face while Fiona tries to regain her composure)

Fiona: I mean--ah, why wait? Let's get married today. Before sunset.

(Shrek glares and turns away)

Lord Farquaad: Oh, anxious, are we? You're right. The sooner, the better. There's so much to do!

(Lord Farquaad snaps his fingers and is lifted onto his horse by his guard. The guard offers Fiona assistance, but she looks up onto the saddle on her own)

Lord Farquaad: There's the caterer, the cake, the band, the guest list. Captain, round up some guests!

(Fiona, Lord Farquaad, and his guards set off towards Duloc. Fiona gives Shrek one last spiteful look)

Fiona: Fare thee well, ogre.

(Donkey catches up to Shrek as he his walking away)

Donkey: Shrek, what are you doing? You're letting her get away!

Shrek: Yeah? So what?

Donkey: Shrek there's something about her you don't know. Look, I-- I talked to her last night... She's --

Shrek: Yeah I know you talked to her last night. You're great pals, aren't ya? Now, if you two are such good friends, why don't you follow her home?!

Donkey: But Shrek, I-- I wanna go with you.

Shrek: Hey I told you, didn't I? You're not coming home with me. I live alone! My swamp! Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody! ESPECIALLY USELESS, PATHETIC, ANNOYING, TALKING DONKEYS!

Donkey: But, I thought...

Shrek: Yeah. Well, you know what? You thought wrong! (storms off)

Donkey: (sadly) Shrek.

(Montage of different scenes. Shrek arrives back home. The swamp is a mess but the fairytale creatures are gone. Fiona is being fitted for her wedding dress. Shrek throws a sunflower into the fireplace. Lord Farquaad proudly tries on his crown. Fiona stares at her wedding cake, pushing down a figure of Lord Farquaad to show his actual height. She notices a suit of armor that reminds her of Shrek. Donkey stops by a river where he finds Dragon crying, both of them happy to see each other. Shrek and Fiona both try to eat dinner but start crying)

SHREK'S SWAMP

(Shrek is sitting at the dinner table when he hears a sound outside. He goes outside to investigate, and sees Donkey assembling a line of branches and small rocks)

Shrek: Donkey? What are you doing?

Donkey: I would think, of all people, you would recognize a wall when you see one.

Shrek: Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed to go around my swamp, not through it.

Donkey: It is, around your half. See that's your half, and this is my half.

Shrek: Oh! Your half? Hmm.

Donkey: Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess. I did half the work. I get half the booty. Now hand me that big ol' rock, the one that looks like your head.

(Shrek starts pulling down the wall and picks up a large branch. Donkey butts his head against it and the 2 struggle over it)

Shrek: Back off!

Donkey: No, you back off.

Shrek: This is my swamp!

Donkey: Our swamp!

Shrek: Let go, Donkey!

Donkey: You let go!

Shrek: Stubborn jackass!

Donkey: Smelly ogre.

Shrek: Fine!

(Shrek suddenly lets go of the branch, tripping Donkey over, and he walks away)

Donkey: Hey, hey, come back here. I'm not through with you yet.

Shrek: Well, I'm through with you!

(Donkey starts following him)

Donkey: Uh-uh! You know, with you it's always "me, me, me!" Well, guess what! Now it's my turn! So you just shut up and pay attention!

(Just as Shrek nears the door to his home, Donkey jumps in front of him. Shrek walks in another direction)

Donkey: You are mean to me, you insult me and you don't appreciate anything that I do! You're always pushing me around or pushing me away.

Shrek: Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back?

Donkey: Because that's what friends do! They forgive each other!

Shrek: Oh, yeah. You're right, Donkey. I forgive you...for stabbing me in the back!

(Shrek enters the outhouse and slams the door behind him)

Donkey: Ohhhhh! You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy, you're afraid of your own feelings.

Shrek: Go away!

Donkey: See! There you are, doing it again just like you did to Fiona. And all she ever do was like you, maybe even love you.

Shrek: Love me? She said I was ugly! A hideous creature! I heard the two of you talking.

Donkey: She wasn't talkin' about you. She was talkin' about...uh...somebody else.

(After a brief silence, Shrek comes up of the outhouse)

Shrek: She wasn't talking about me? Well then who was she talking about?

(Donkey turns his back to Shrek)

Donkey: Uh-uh, no way. I ain't saying anything. You don't wanna listen to me. Right? Right?

Shrek: Donkey!

Donkey: No!

Shrek: Okay, look. I'm sorry, all right?

(Donkey turns his head back to raise his eyebrow, and then looks away again. Shrek sighs)

Shrek: I'm sorry. I guess I am just a big, stupid...ugly ogre. Can you forgive me?

Donkey: Hey, that's what friends are for, right?

Shrek: Right. Friends?

Donkey: Friends.

(Shrek and Donkey shake on it)

Shrek: So, um, what did Fiona say about me?

Donkey: What are you asking me for? Why don't you just go ask her?

Shrek: The wedding! We'll never make it in time.

Donkey: Ha-ha-ha! Never fear, for where, there's a will, there's a way and I have a way.

(Donkey whistles loudly, and Shrek looks up to see Dragon flying overhead)

Shrek: Donkey?!

Donkey: I guess it's just my animal magnetism.

Shrek: (laughs) Aw, come here, you.

(Shrek gives Donkey a noogie)

Donkey: All right, all right. Don't get all slobbery. No one likes a kiss ass. All right, hop on and hold on tight. I haven't had a chance to install the seat belts yet.

(Shrek climbs up the chain still slung around Dragon's neck. Dragon lifts Donkey up with her hand. They take off, soaring through the clouds and to Duloc)

DULOC CATHEDRAL - INTERIOR

(The church is packed with citizens. Fiona and Farquaad are standing at the altar as the priest conducts the ceremony. Thelonius stands nearby, golding a pillow on which rests the two wedding rings. Men with prompter cards hold up cards that says 'Revered Silence')

Bishop: People of Duloc, we gather here today to bear witness to the union....

(Fiona glances nervously at the window, noticing the sun slowly dropping toward the horizon)

Fiona: Um-

Bishop: ...of our new king...

Fiona: Excuse me. Could we just skip ahead to the "I do's"?

(Lord Farquaad chuckles then motions to the bishop to indulge Fiona)

Lord Farquaad: Go on.

DULOC CATHEDRAL - EXTERIOR

(A large group of guards stand outside the cathedral on watch. Suddenly Dragon lands nearby and the guards flee in terror. Dragon looks back at Donkey after him and Shrek climb off of her back)

Donkey: Go ahead, have some fun. If we need you, I'll whistle. How about that?

(Dragon smiles, and nods, and takes off towards the town streets. Shrek runs for the cathedral doors but Donkey hurries to get in his way)

Donkey: Shrek, wait, wait! Wait a minute! You wanna do this right, don't you?

Shrek: What are you talking about?

Donkey: There's a line, there's a line you gotta wait for. The priest is gonna say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace." And that's when you say, "I object!"

Shrek: Oh, I don't have time for this!

Donkey: Hey, wait. What are you doing? Listen to me!

(Shrek pushes past him but Donkey pins him against the door)

Donkey: Look, you love this woman, don't you?

Shrek: Yes.

Donkey: You wanna hold her?

Shrek: Yes.

Donkey: Please her?

Shrek: Yes!

Donkey: (singing) "Then you got to, got to try a little tenderness". (talking) The chicks love that romantic crap!

Shrek: All right! Cut it out! When does this guy say the line?

Donkey: We gotta check it out.

INTERIOR

As the bishop talks we see Donkey through one of the windows as Shrek tosses him up so he can see.

Bishop: And so, by the power vested in me...

EXTERIOR

Shrek: What do you see?!

Donkey: The whole town's in there.

Bishop: I now pronounce you husband and wife...

Donkey: They're at the altar!

Bishop: ...king and queen.

Donkey: Mother Fletcher! He already said it.

Shrek: Oh, for the love of Pete!

(Shrek runs inside without catching Donkey, who hits the ground hard)

INTERIOR

(Fiona and Lord Farquaad are leaning in to kiss, but are interrupted when Shrek bursts through the doors. They both turn to see him running down the aisle)

Shrek: I object!

Fiona: Shrek?

(Fiona initially looks happily surprised to see him, but quickly becomes upset. The bishop gasps, shuts his book, and quietly slinks off)

Lord Farquaad: Oh, now what does he want?

(The whole congregation gasps as they see Shrek walk ahead towards the altar. They respond positively to him and begin to do "the wave")

Shrek: Hi, everyone. Having a good time, are ya? I love Duloc, first of all. Very clean.

Fiona: What are you doing here?

Lord Farquaad: Really, it's rude enough being alive when no one wants you, but showing up uninvited to a wedding...

(Shrek initially seems taken aback by Farquaad's unnecessarily harsh comment, but he quickly brushes it off and turns his attention towards Fiona)

Shrek: Fiona! I need to talk to you.

Fiona: Oh, now you wanna talk? Well, it's a little late for that, so if you'll excuse me--

(She leans over to kiss Farquaad but Shrek pulls her away by the hand)

Shrek: But you can't marry him!

(She frees her hand from his grip)

Fiona: And why not?

Shrek: Because, because he's just marrying you so he can be king!

(The crowd gasps)

Lord Farquaad: Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him--

Shrek: He's not your true love.

FIONA: And what do you know about true love?!

Shrek: Well, I--uh--I mean...

(Fiona is taken aback by this)

Lord Farquaad: Oh, this is precious. (laughs) The ogre has fallen in love with the princess! Oh, good Lord. (laughs)

(Lord Farquaad gestures to the man with the prompter card holds up a card that says 'Laugh'. The whole congregation laughs)

Lord Farquaad: An ogre and a princess! (laughs)

(Shrek looks back at the laughing crowd and then down at the floor, dejected)

Fiona: Shrek, is this true?

Lord Farquaad: Who cares?! It's preposterous! Fiona, my love, we're but a kiss away from our "happily ever after." Now kiss me!

(Lord Farquaad holds Fiona's hand, puckers his lips, and leans toward her. She looks down at him with disgust, and then averts her attention to the window. The sun is just about to set)

Fiona: "By night one way, by day another." I wanted to show you before.

(Fiona backs up and gives Shrek a sheepish smile. As the sun sets, she changes into her ogre self. The crowd gasps and one person faints. Shrek stares at Fiona in astonishment, and then grins)

Shrek: Well, uh, that explains a lot!

(Fiona locks eyes with Shrek and smiles)

Lord Farquaad: Ugh! It's disgusting! Guards! Guards! I order you to get them out of my sight now!

(A large amount of guards run in and grab ahold of Shrek and Fiona)

Lord Farquaad: Get them! Get them both!

Fiona: No, no! Shrek!

(Shrek and Fiona try to grab each other's arms as they are pulled away from each other. Lord Farquaad grabs ahold of his crown and puts it on)

Lord Farquaad: All this hocus-pocus alters nothing, this marriage is binding, and that makes me king! SEE?! SEE?!

Fiona: No, let go of me! Shrek!

Shrek: No!

Lord Farquaad: Don't just stand there, you morons!

Shrek: Get out of my way! Fiona!

Lord Farquaad: Kill him if you have to--but get him!

(Shrek angrily fights back and knocks out a few of the guards, but they are able to subdue him through sheer numbers)

Lord Farquaad: Beast, I'll make you regret the day we met! I'll see you drawn and quartered! You'll beg for death to save you!

Fiona: No, Shrek!

Lord Farquaad : And as for you, my wife!

(Lord Farquaad pulls out a dagger and holds it to Fiona's throat)

Shrek: Fiona!

Lord Farquaad: I'll have you locked back in that tower for the rest of your days! I am king!

(Shrek manages to pulls his arm free and he whistles loudly)

Lord Farquaad: I will have order! I will have perfection! I will have--

(Suddenly Dragon, with Donkey atop her head, crashes through a large window behind him. Lord Farquaad drops his weapon & looks up.)

Lord Farquaad: Aaah! Aah!

(Dragon swoops down and swallows him up in one gulp. The guards either run away or step back.)

Donkey: All right! Nobody move! I got a dragon here, and I'm not afraid to use it.

(Dragon roars, causing most of the guards to away in fear. The remaining guards let go of Shrek and Fiona, backing away)

Donkey: I'm a donkey on the edge!

(Dragon belches and Lord Farquaad's crown flies out of her mouth and falls to the ground)

Donkey: Celebrity marriages. They never last, do they?

(The congregation laughs and cheers)

Donkey: Go ahead, Shrek.

Shrek: Uh, Fiona?

Fiona: Yes, Shrek?

Shrek: I -- I love you.

Fiona: Really?

Shrek: Really, really.

Fiona: I love you too.

(Shrek and Fiona kiss. Thelonius takes one of the cards and writes 'Awwww' on the back and shows it to the congregation. Suddenly the magic of the spell pulls Fiona away. She's lifted up into the air and she hovers while the magic works around her. Fiona's voice is heard although she isn't moving her lips)

Fiona: "Until you find true love's first kiss and then take love's true form. Take love's true form. Take love's true form."

(Suddenly Fiona's eyes open wide and light up. The force of the spell blows against the crowd and all the windows. All except for one with an image of Farquaad on it, which Dragon breaks with her fist. Fiona is lowered to the ground and Shrek runs up to her)

Shrek: Fiona? Fiona. Are you all right?

(Fiona slowly stands up, still an ogress)

Fiona: Well, yes...Because I don't understand. I'm supposed to be beautiful.

Shrek: But you are beautiful.

(They smile at each other)

Donkey: I was hoping this would be a happy ending.

(Shrek and Fiona)

THE SWAMP

Shrek and Fiona are now joined in matrimony in Shrek's swamp. Among the attendees are the fairytale creatures once banished to the swamp, as well as a few Duloc Guards. Shrek and Fiona walk down the aisle to their awaiting carriage, which is made of a giant onion. Fiona tosses her bouquet which both Cinderella and Snow White try to catch. They end get into a cat fight and Dragon catches the bouquet instead. Donkey looks nervous, but Shrek and Fiona give him reassuring looks. Gingy has been mended somewhat and now has one leg and walks with a candy cane cane.

Gingy: God bless us, every one.

The guests party and dance as Donkey takes over singing The Monkees song. Shrek and Fiona ride away in their carriage. Cut to a storybook that reads "And they lived ugly ever after...THE END".

Donkey: (as he's done singing and we fade to black) Oh, that's funny. Oh. Oh. I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

[A light shines down on a same storybook from the first movie. It opens, and an English-accented voice (Prince Charming) turns the pages and reads it this time.]

Prince Charming: Once upon a time in a kingdom far far away, the king and queen were blessed with a beautiful baby girl. And throughout the land, everyone was happy. Until the sun went down, and they saw that their daughter was cursed with a frightful enchantment that took hold each and every night. Desperate, they sought the help of a fairy godmother; who had them lock the young princess away in a tower, there to await the kiss of the handsome Prince Charming!

[Book transitions to Prince Charming, wearing a knight's armor and red cape, riding on horseback. He rides through a forest, snowy mountains and barren desert]

Prince Charming: It was he who would chance the perilous journey through blistering cold and scorching desert traveling for many days and nights, risking life and limb to reach the Dragon’s Keep.

EXT. - DRAGON'S KEEP

[Prince Charming arrives at the Dragon's Keep, an ominous castle surrounded by a moat of lava, but sees that the wooden bridge leading across the lava was destroyed by the Dragon from the first movie. Charming uses his bow to shoot a roped arrow to a wooden post on the other side and uses it as a zipline. He looks up at a tower that rises above the rest of the castle, a light shining from its window. He enters the Dragon's Keep]

INT. - DRAGON'S KEEP

Prince Charming: For he was the bravest...

[Prince Charming takes off his helmet, revealing himself to be the narrator's voice. He continues to speak aloud]

Prince Charming: …and most handsome…

[He takes off his hair net and dramatically swishes his hair]

Prince Charming: ...in all the land. And it was destiny that his kiss...

[He sprays air freshener in his mouth]

Prince Charming: …would break the dreaded curse.

[Prince Charming continues through the abandoned castle and reaches the princess' tower]

INT. - THE PRINCESS'S TOWER

[He enters the princess' room and makes his way to her bed where a figure lays down, obscured by the bed's curtains]

Prince Charming: He alone would climb to the highest room of the tallest tower to enter the princess’s chambers, cross the room to her sleeping silhouette, pull back the gossamer curtains to find her--

[Prince Charming pulls the curtain and gasps; the figure is no princess--it's Big Bad Wolf. He is annoyed by the interruption]

Big Bad Wolf: What?

Prince Charming: Princess…Fiona?

Big Bad Wolf: No!

Prince Charming: Oh, thank heavens. Where is she?

Big Bad Wolf: She’s on her honeymoon.

Prince Charming: Honeymoon?! With whom?!

----

[We see various scenes from Shrek and Fiona's honeymoon with the music "Accidentally in Love" by Counting Crows playing. They enter a giant gingerbread house and spend the night there. In the morning, Little Red Riding Hood knocks on the door, fleeing in terror after Shrek and Fiona answer the door. They take the basket she left and have a picnic on the beach. A wave crashes over Shrek and Fiona as they make out in the sand and the Little Mermaid takes Fiona's place. Fiona drags the mermaid by the tail, and throws her into the sea into a group of sharks. Later, Shrek has some dwarves forge Fiona's wedding ring. They run happily through a meadow where an angry mob emerges, chasing after them. Shrek gets caught a trap and villagers surround Fiona, who fends them off. They take turns farting in a mud bath, using fairies trapped in jars for light. They kiss in the moonlight, transitioning to...

EXT. - SWAMP

...their arrival back at Shrek's swamp]

Shrek: It’s so good to be home!

[Shrek scoops Fiona about in his arms and walks to the door of his home]

Shrek: Just you and me and…

[Singing can be heard from inside.]

INT. - SHREK'S HOUSE

[They open the door to find Donkey laying in Shrek's chair]

Donkey: Two can be as bad as one…

Shrek: Donkey?

[Shrek sets Fiona down]

Donkey: Shrek! Fiona! Well aren’t you two a sight for sore eyes! Give us a hug, Shrek, you old love machine. [chuckles] And look at you, Mrs. Shrek. How ‘bout a side of sugar for the steed?

Shrek: Donkey, what are you doing here?

Donkey: Oh! I was just taking care of your love nest for you.

Shrek: Oh, you mean like… sorting the mail and watering the plants?

[Shrek gestures to piles of mail stacked on a stool and potted plants that have withered away]

Donkey: Yeah, and feeding the fish!

Shrek: I don’t have any fish.

Donkey: You do now. I call that one Shrek and the other Fiona.

[Donkey walks over to a fish bowl. The water is rancid and the two fish are clearly dead]

Donkey: That Shrek is a rascally devil. Get your…[mumbling]

Shrek: Oh, would you look at the time? Well I guess you’d better be going.

[Shrek opens the front door and beckons Donkey to head out]

Donkey: Hey wait a minute, don’t you want to tell me all about your trip? Or how about a game of Parcheesi?

[Donkey runs back over to the fireplace and Shrek groans in frustration]

Fiona: Um, actually--Donkey? Shouldn’t you be getting home to Dragon?

Donkey: Oh, yeah, that. I don’t know. She’s been all moody and stuff lately...so I thought I’d move back in with you guys!

Fiona: Well you know we’re always happy to see you, Donkey.

[Fiona kneels down to pat Donkey on the head, then Shrek puts his hands on her shoulders]

Shrek: But Fiona and I are married now. We need a little time, you know, to be together.

[Donkey smiles and stares at Shrek, not taking the hint]

Shrek: Just with each other.

[Donkey continues to stare]

Shrek: Alone.

Donkey: Say no more, say no more. You don’t have to worry about a thing. I will always be here to make sure nobody bothers you!

Shrek: Donkey!

Donkey: Yes, roomie?

Shrek: You’re bothering me.

Donkey: Oh, okay. All right, cool. I guess uh… me and Pinocchio was gonna catch a tournament, anyway, so uh.... maybe I’ll see y’all Sunday for a barbecue or something.

[Donkey solemnly walks out the door and shuts it behind him]

Shrek: He’ll be fine. Now, where were we?

[Fiona puts her hands on his arm]

Shrek: Oh. I think I remember.

[The two giggle and Shrek takes her in his arms. He leans her over for a kiss, but they are interrupted by Donkey, who is suddenly standing next to them again]

Shrek: Donkey!

[In his surprise, Shrek accidentally drops Fiona. He leans down to pick her up]

Donkey: I know, I know! Alone! I’m going! I’m going! Hey, but what do you want me to tell these other guys?

[Donkey opens the door, and Shrek and Fiona look up, puzzled]

EXT. - SHREK'S HOME

[A group of uniformed men stand outside, playing a fanfare with their trumpets and drums. A page steps forth with a scroll in his hand. After the fanfare is over, one of the trumpeters begins play the Hawaii Five-0 Theme Song. The page smacks him on the head with his scroll. Shrek and Fiona step outside of the house]

Page: Enough, Reggie. [clears throat] "Dearest Princess Fiona. You are hereby summoned to the Kingdom of Far, Far Away for a royal ball in celebration of your marriage...

[Upon hearing this news Shrek looks uneasy, while Fiona is smiling]

Page: ...at which time the King will bestow his royal blessing… upon you and your…eh...

[He looks up from the scroll and stares at Shrek]

Page: uh…Prince Charming. Love, the King and Queen of Far Far Away. A.K.A. Mom and Dad."

Fiona: Mom and Dad?

Shrek: Prince Charming?

Donkey: Royal ball?! Can I come?

Shrek: We’re not going.

Fiona & Donkey: What?!

Shrek: I mean, don’t you think they might be a bit… shocked to see you like this?

Fiona: Well, they might be a bit surprised. But they’re my parents, Shrek. They love me. And don’t worry, they're gonna love you too.

Shrek: Yeah, right. Somehow I don’t think I’ll be welcome at the country club.

Fiona: Will you stop it? They’re not like that.

Shrek: Then how do you explain Sergeant Pompous and the Fancy Pants Club Band?

[The page gives a huff, and walks off with the rest of the men]

Fiona: Oh, come on! You could at least give them a chance.

Shrek: To do what? Sharpen their pitchforks?

Fiona: No! They just want to give you their blessing.

Shrek: Oh, great. Now I need their blessing?

Fiona: Well, if you want to be a part of this family, yes!

Shrek: And who says I want to be part of this family?

Fiona: Uh, you did! When you married me?!

Shrek: Well, there’s some fine print for you!

Fiona: Ugh! So that’s it, you won’t come?

Shrek: Trust me. It’s a bad idea. We are not going! And that’s final!

[After a silence, we cut to Fiona throwing the last of their luggage into the back of their carriage]

Donkey: Hey, come on, Shrek! We don’t want to hit traffic!

Gingy: Don’t worry! We’ll take care of everything.

[Shrek reluctantly leaves the house. Gingy, Pinocchio, the Three Little Pigs, Big Bad Wolf, and the Three Blind Mice run inside. One of the mice is running to catch up]

Blind Mouse: Hey, wait for me! Oof!

[The door shuts and the mouse runs into it. Shrek groans as he hears sounds of glass breaking and music playing. Shrek, Fiona, and Donkey get in the carriage and set out for Far Far Away]

Donkey: Hit it! Move ‘em on! Head ‘em up! Head ‘em up, move ‘em on! Head ‘em up! Move ‘em down! Rawhide! Move 'em on! Head ‘em up! Head ‘em up! Move ‘em on! Move ‘em on! Head ‘em up! Rawhide! Ride ‘em up! Move ‘em on!

COUNTRYSIDE

Donkey: Head ‘em up! Head ‘em up! Move ‘em on! Rawhide! Knock ‘em out! Pound ‘em dead! Make ‘em tea! Buy ‘em drinks! Meet their mamas! Milk ‘em hard! Rawhide! Yee-haw!

[Later, they reach a sign that reads "700 miles to Far Far Away"]

Donkey: Are we there yet?

Shrek: No.

MOUNTAINS

[They are now riding in the rain over a rocky terrain]

Donkey: Are we there yet?

Fiona: Not yet.

[They are now on a snowy mountain. A sign reads "200 miles to Far Far Away"]

Donkey: Okay, are we there yet?

Fiona: No.

[More time passes and they are riding through thick snow]

Donkey: Are we there yet?

Shrek: No!

[They are riding out of the snowy area]

Donkey: Are we there yet?

Shrek: (sarcastically) Yes.

Donkey: Really?

Shrek: No!

[They pass by a waterfall and over a bridge]

Donkey: Are we there yet?

Fiona: No!

FOREST

[They pass a sign that reads "100 miles to Far Far Away"]

Donkey: Are we there yet?!

Shrek: No, we are not!

[Later as they pass through the forest, their dwarf driver is now covering his ears as he holds the reigns]

Donkey: Are we there yet?!

Shrek & Fiona: No!

[Shrek begins mimicking Donkey]

Donkey: Are we there yet?

Shrek: Are we there yet?

Donkey: Hey, that’s not funny.

Shrek: Hey, that’s not funny.

Donkey: Hey, that’s really immature.

Shrek: Hey, that’s really immature.

Donkey: See, this is why nobody likes ogres.

Shrek: See, this is why nobody likes ogres.

Donkey: Alright, your loss!

Shrek: Alright, your loss!

Donkey: I’m gonna just stop talking!

Shrek: Finally!

Donkey: But this is taking forever, Shrek. And there ain't no in-flight movie or nothing!

Shrek: The Kingdom of Far Far Away, Donkey. That’s where we’re going. Far Far… [whispers] Away!

Donkey: All right, all right, I get it. I’m just so darn bored!

Shrek: Well, find a way to entertain yourself!

[Donkey sighs. After a pause he sighs heavily. Then he makes a popping sound with his mouth. Then pops again. And again.]

Shrek: Oh! For 5 minutes. Could you not be yourself… for 5 minutes!

[Fiona leans against the window and looks out. She looks back to see Donkey's mouth lean forward. She braces herself and Donkey makes the popping noise again]

Shrek: [screams] Are we there yet?!

Fiona: [chuckles] Yes!

Donkey: Oh, finally!

[Off in the distance they see the Kingdom of Far Far Away]

INT. - KINGDOM OF FAR FAR AWAY

[They pass through the front gates]

Donkey: Wow! It’s going to be champagne wishes and caviar dreams from now on!

[The streets are paved and there are buildings everywhere. People fill the sidewalks and carriages fill the road]

Donkey: Hey, good-looking! We’ll be back to pick you up later! Ooh, pantyhose!

[Fiona looks out with excitement, while Shrek remains cautious]

Shrek: We are definitely not in the swamp anymore.

[A crossing guard dressed in full armor brings them to a halt as a limousine-esque carriage passes by]

Guard: Halt!

[A man walks up to the horses and cleans them off, and the carriage driver tosses him a coin]

Woman: Hey, everyone, look!

[Two women take note of their carriage and start following it. Soon, others take notice and join in. Fiona turns to Shrek, who is clearly not enjoying this. She gives him a reassuring smile, and he tries to return one back]

Donkey: Hey, ladies! Nice day for a parade, huh? Yeah! You working that hat!

[A loud crowd has now amassed behind them. They head up the avenue and towards the palace further up the road]

Donkey: Swimming pools! Movie stars!

EXT. - FAR FAR AWAY PALACE

[A cheering crowd is gathered in front of the palace, filling up the entirety of the square. Confetti rains and fanfare plays. The King and Queen stand waiting in front of the palace doors. The carriage pulls and stops in front of the red carpet leading to the palace. An announcer pulls out a scroll and reads it aloud]

Announcer: Announcing the long-awaited return of the beautiful Princess Fiona and her new husband!

[The crowd cheers]

Fiona: Well, this is it.

King Harold: This is it.

Announcer: This is it.

[A man with a box of doves gets ready to open it]

Man: This is it.

[The birds are released and a fanfare is played as Shrek, Fiona, and Donkey step out of the carriage. The crowd gasps, the fanfare dies off, and one of the doves smacks into a wall and falls to the ground. The King and Queen stand with mouths wide open. It is totally silent. A baby starts cries and laughs]

Donkey: Uh… why don’t you guys go ahead? I’ll park the car.

[Donkey jumps into the carriage and the driver starts riding off. Shrek takes Fiona's hand and starts walking forward]

Shrek: So… (chuckles) ...you still think this was a good idea?

Fiona: Of course! Look! Mom and Dad look happy to see us.

[The King and Queen start walking forward and talk amongst themselves]

King Harold: Who on earth are they?

Queen Lillian : I think that’s our little girl.

King Harold: That’s not little! That’s a really big problem! Wasn’t she supposed to kiss Prince Charming and break the spell?

Queen Lillian: Well, he’s no Prince Charming, but they do look--

Shrek: Happy now? We came. We saw them.

[Shrek nervously chuckles as they pass by a few men carrying pitchforks]

Shrek: Now let’s go before they light the torches.

Fiona: They’re my parents!

Shrek: Hello? They locked you in a tower!

Fiona: Hey! That was for my own--

King Harold: Good! Now here’s our chance. Let’s go back inside and pretend we’re not home!

[King Harold tries to start walking back but Queen Lillian urges him forward]

Queen Lillian: Harold, we have to be--

Shrek: Quick! While they’re not looking we could make a run for it.

Fiona: Shrek! Stop it! Everything’s gonna be--

King Harold: A disaster! There is no way--

Fiona: You can do this.

Shrek: I really--

King Harold: Really--

Queen Lillian: Really--

Shrek: Don't--

Queen Lillian: Want--

Shrek: To…

Queen Lillian: Be--

Shrek/King Harold: Here.

[The four stand facing each other. After a brief silence, Fiona goes up to hug King Harold and Queen Lillian]

Fiona: Mom, Dad. I’d like you to meet my husband…Shrek.

[Shrek stands nervously. Queen Lillian tries to appear happy to meet him, while King Harold doesn't even try to hide his disgusted look]

Shrek: Well, um… It’s easy to see where Fiona gets her good looks from.

[Shrek chuckles nervously. King Harold glares, Queen Lillian is apprehensive, and Fiona cringes]

INT. - FAR FAR AWAY PALACE. DINING ROOM.

[We cut Shrek to gulping at the dinner table. To his sides sits Fiona and Queen Lillian, and across from him sits King Harold. Queen Lillian looks around nervously and King Harold glares at Shrek. Shrek, unsure of how to eat the food on his plate properly, plops it in his mouth, and grins with the food still stuck in his teeth. Queen Lillian cringes. Fiona tries to sip her drink courteously, but lets out a loud belch and covers her mouth]

Fiona: Excuse me.

[Shrek and Fiona laugh]

Shrek: Better out than in, I always say, eh, Fiona?

Shrek: That’s good...

[They stop laughing after neither King Harold nor Queen Lillian join in]

Shrek: I guess not...

[We hear Donkey yelling in another room]

Donkey: What do you mean, "not on the list"? Don’t tell me you don’t know who I am.

[Donkey comes bursting in the room from the kitchen]

Donkey: Hey! What’s happening, everybody? Thanks for waiting. You know I had the hardest time finding this place.

[Donkey pulls up a seat next to King Harold]

King Harold: No! No! Bad donkey! Bad! Down!

Fiona: No, no, no, Dad! It’s all right! It’s all right. He’s with us. He helped rescue me from the dragon.

Donkey: Yup, that's me. The noble steed. Hey, waiter! How ‘bout a bowl for the steed?

Shrek: Oh, boy...

[Shrek loudly slurps from his bowl]

Fiona: Um, Shrek?

Shrek: Yeah?..Oh! Sorry! Great soup, Mrs. Q. Mmm!

Fiona: No, no. Darling.

[Fiona demonstrates that the bowl he ate from is for washing his hands]

Shrek: Oh!

[The rest of the dinner table does the same]

Queen Lillian: So, Fiona, tell us about where you live.

Fiona: Well…Shrek owns his own land. Don’t you, honey?

Shrek: Oh, yes! It’s in an enchanted forest abundant in squirrels and...cute little duckies and--

Donkey: What?! (laughing) I know you ain’t talking about the swamp!

Shrek: (gritting his teeth) Donkey!

King Harold: (sarcastically) An ogre from a swamp. Oh! How original.

[Donkey dunks his mouth into his bowl and starts drinking]

Queen Lillian: Well, I suppose that would be a fine place to raise the children...

[King Harold starts choking on his drink and Shrek accidentally swallows his spoon. They both gag until Shrek spits his spoon out onto the table]

Shrek: (chuckling) It’s a bit early to be thinking about that, isn’t it?

King Harold: Indeed. I just started eating.

Queen Lillian: Harold!

Shrek: (offended) What’s that supposed to mean?

Fiona: Dad. It’s great, okay?

King Harold: Well, for his type, yes.

Shrek: My type?!

Donkey: Uhhh--I gotta go to the bathroom.

[The chef and a host of servers enter the room with dinner, including a whole turkey , lobster, and a pig.]

Chef: Dinner is served!

Donkey: Never mind. I can hold it.

[The servers set the food on the table]

Chef: Bon appetit!

Donkey: Ooh, Mexican food! My favorite!

Queen Lillian: Well, let’s not just sit here with our tummies rumbling. Everybody dig in!

Donkey: Don’t mind if I do, Lillian.

King Harold: So, I suppose any grandchildren I could expect from you would be--

Shrek: Ogres, yes!

[King Harold pulls the lobster towards himself, Shrek does the same with the turkey]

Queen Lillian: Not that there’s anything wrong with that. Right, Harold?

King Harold: Oh, no! No! Of course, not! That is, assuming you don’t eat your own young!

[King Harold violently stabs the lobster with a knife]

Fiona: Dad!

Shrek: Oh, no, we usually prefer the ones who’ve been locked away in a tower!

[Shrek rips off both drumsticks off the turkey and bites them]

Fiona: Shrek, please!

King Harold: I only did that because I love her!

[King Harold pierces a piece from the lobster and shoves it to the boiler]

Shrek: Oh, aye! Daycare or dragon-guarded castle?!

[Shrek rips out the wishbone from the turkey]

King Harold: You wouldn’t understand! You’re not her father!

[Fiona sighs as Shrek and King Harold continue to rip apart their food, sending bits and pieces flying across the table]

Queen Lillian: It’s so nice to have the family together for dinner.

[Shrek and King Harold tug over the pig in the middle of the table, accidentally sending it flying upwards]

Queen Lillian: Harold!

Fiona: Shrek!

Shrek: Fiona!

King Harold: Fiona!

Fiona: Mom!

Queen Lillian: Harold…

Donkey: Donkey!

[The pig lands on the table with a thud. Fiona looks at Shrek and King Harold, and then runs out of the room]

INT. - FAR FAR AWAY PALACE. FIONA'S BEDROOM.

[Fiona enters her room where she stayed as a child. She looks affectionately at a doll of a princess, then moves on. She goes out to her balcony and cries a single tear, then suddenly notices bubbles floating all around her. A woman in the distance floats inside of a bubble and begins to sing.]

Fairy Godmother: Your fallen tears have called to me / So, here comes my sweet remedy / I know what every princess needs / For her to live life happily…

[The woman floats up to her and pops the bubble. She notices Fiona, and both gasp]

Fairy Godmother: Oh! Oh, my dear. Oooh, look at you, you're all um...grown up. [chuckles]

Fiona: Um, who are you?

Fairy Godmother: Oh, sweet pea! I’m your Fairy Godmother.

Fiona: I have a fairy godmother?

Fairy Godmother: Shu-shu-shu--shush, shush. Now, don’t worry. I’m here to make it all better. With...just...a…

[Fairy Godmother flies into the room and starts singing again]

Fairy Godmother: ...wave of my magic wand! / Your troubles will soon be gone! / With a flick of the wrist and just a flash / You’ll land a prince with a ton of cash

[She conjures up a load of gold coins]

Fairy Godmother: A high-priced dress made by mice no less / Some crystal glass pumps / And no more stress

[Out of the closet comes a sparkling gold dress that floats its way onto Fiona]

Fairy Godmother: Your worries will vanish, your soul will cleanse / Confide in your very own furniture friends

[The furniture starts to animate and move around. They begin to sing along]

Fairy Godmother: We’ll help you set a new fashion trend!

[Suddenly they are in a spacious room. A chair swoops up Fiona and carries her over to a mirror]

Fairy Godmother: I’ll make you fancy, I’ll make you great

Furniture: The kind of girl a prince would date!

Fairy Godmother: They’ll write your name on the bathroom wall…

Mirror: For a happy ever after, give Fiona a call!

Fairy Godmother: A sporty carriage to ride in style / Sexy man boy chauffeur, Kyle

[A giant pink carriage appears with the aforementioned Kyle laying down on top of it, who cracks a whip. The furniture dances around Fiona]

Fairy Godmother: Banish your blemishes, tooth decay / Cellulite thighs will fade away! / And oh, what the hey! / Have a bichon frisé!

[A small puppy lands in Fiona's hands. Various makeup appliances begin to pester Fiona]

Fairy Godmother: Nip and tuck, here and there / To land that prince with the perfect hair / Lipstick liners, shadows blush / To get that prince with the sexy tush / Lucky day, hunk buffet / You and your prince take a roll in the hay / You can spoon on the moon / With the prince to the tune

[Fairy Godmother and Kyle begin to dance and the music gets faster and more frantic]

Fiona: Stop, please!

Fairy Godmother: Don’t be drab, you’ll be fab / Your prince will have rock-hard abs / Cheese soufflé, Valentine’s Day / Have some chicken fricassee! / Nip and tuck, here and there / To land that prince with the perfect hair--

Fiona: Stop!

[The music stops and Fiona's fancy dress turns to dust]

Fiona: (chuckles) Look...thank you very much, Fairy Godmother, but I really don’t need all this.

[Fairy Godmother and the furniture collectively gasp, the furniture begins to shuffle away, grumbling]

[Shrek starts knocking at the door and a shelf moves over to blocks it]

Shrek: Fiona? Fiona?

[Shrek forces his way in and to see Fairy Godmother floating next to Fiona, who has the puppy in her arms. The furniture move back to their original positions. Fairy Godmother looks surprised to see Shrek. Donkey comes running in]

Donkey: Oh! You got a puppy? All I got in my room was shampoo.

Fiona: Oh...uh…Fairy Godmother, furniture…I’d like you to meet my husband, Shrek.

Fairy Godmother: (in disbelief) Your husband? What--what did you say? When did this happen?

Fiona: Shrek is the one who rescued me.

Fairy Godmother: But that can’t be right!

Shrek: Oh, great, more relatives!

Fiona: She’s just trying to help.

Shrek: Good! She can help us pack. Get your coat, dear. We’re leaving.

[Shrek opens up his suitcase]

Fiona: What?

Donkey: Leaving? I don’t want to leave.

Fiona: When did you decide this?

Shrek: Shortly after arriving.

Fiona: Look, I I’m sorry…

Fairy Godmother: No, no, no, no, that’s all right. I need to go, anyway. But remember, dear, if you should ever need me…happiness…is just a teardrop away.

[Fairy Godmother holds out a business card to Fiona, but Shrek snatches it out of her hand]

Shrek: Thanks, but we’ve got all the happiness we need. Happy, happy, happy!

Fairy Godmother: So I see...let’s go, Kyle.

[Fairy Godmother steps out the balcony and flies away in the pink carriage with Kyle driving]

Fiona: Very nice, Shrek.

Shrek: What? I told you coming here was a bad idea.

Fiona: You could’ve at least tried to get along with my father!

Shrek: You know, somehow I don’t think I was going to get Daddy’s blessing even if I did want it!

[The puppy starts barking]

Fiona: Well, do you think it might be nice if somebody asked me what I wanted?

Shrek: Sure. Do you want me to pack for you?

Fiona: You’re unbelievable! You’re behaving like a…

Shrek: Go on! Say it!

Fiona: Like an ogre!

Shrek: Well, here’s a news flash for you! Whether your parents like it or not… I am an ogre!

[The puppy continues to bark and Shrek roars in its face. It stops and cowers]

Donkey: Wow! So this was right in ogres are like onions.

Shrek: And guess what, princess? That’s not about to change.

Fiona: I’ve made changes for you, Shrek. Think about that.

[Fiona steps out and the lets the door slam behind her]

Donkey: That’s real smooth, Shrek. "I’m an ogre!" [mimics Shrek roars]

Shrek: No, Donkey! That's my roar, not yours! I thinking Puss in Boots gets here.

[Shrek goes to open the door but hears Fiona crying. He sighs and leans his back to the door]

Shrek: Fiona? I'm so sorry.

INT. - FAR FAR AWAY PALACE. MASTER BEDROOM.

[Up one floor from Fiona's room, King Harold stands at a balcony. He has been listening the whole time]

King Harold: I knew this would happen.

[Queen Lillian speaks from inside the room]

Queen Lillian: You should. You started it.

[King Harold walks back inside the bedroom. Queen Lillian is sitting in bed with a book in hand]

King Harold: I can hardly believe that, Lillian. I mean really, he's the ogre. Not me.

Queen Lillian: I think, Harold, you’re taking this a little too personally. This is Fiona’s choice.

King Harold: Yes, but she was supposed to choose the prince we picked out for her! I mean, you expect me to give my blessings to this…this...thing?

Queen Lillian: Fiona does. And she’ll never forgive you if you don’t. I don’t want to lose our daughter again, Harold.

[King Harold sighs]

Queen Lillian: Ugh, you act as if love is totally predictable. Don’t you remember when we were young? And oh, we used to walk down by the lily pond and they were in bloom…

King Harold: (starting to reminisce) Our first kiss... (snapping out of it) it’s not the same! I don’t think you realize that our daughter has married a monster!

Queen Lillian: Oh, stop being such a drama king.

King Harold: Fine! Fine! Pretend there’s nothing wrong! (dances around) La, di, da, di, da, di da! Isn’t it all wonderful! I’d like to know how it could get any worse!

[From behind him, Fairy Godmother's carriage floats up to the balcony and Fairy Godmother opens the door]

Fairy Godmother: Hello, Harold.

[King Harold yelps]

Queen Lillian: What happened?

King Harold: Uh, nothing! Nothing, dear! Just the old crusade wound playing up a bit! [chuckles] I’ll... just stretch it out here for a while!

[He walks out to the balcony and shuts the doors behind him]

Fairy Godmother: You better get in. We need to talk.

King Harold: Actually, Fairy Godmother, off to bed. [yawns] Already taken my pills, and they tend to make me a bit drowsy. So, um how about…

[A large man steps behind King Harold]

King Harold: ...uh, we, we make this a quick visit. What? What?

INT. - GODMOTHER'S CARRAIGE

[The man shoves him inside the carriage and enters after him. King Harold sits between the man and another similar looking man to his other side]

King Harold: Oh, hello. Ha-ha-ha!

[The carriage flies off]

King Harold: So, what’s new?

[Fairy Godmother sits across from King Harold, and next to her sits Prince Charming]

Fairy Godmother: You remember my son, Prince Charming?

King Harold: Charming! Oh! Is that you? My gosh! It's been years! How--when...when, when, when did you get back?

Prince Charming: (calmly) Oh, about 5 minutes ago, actually... (angrily) after I endured blistering winds! Scorching desert! I climbed to the highest room of the tallest tower–-

[Prince Charming, who is now standing up from his seat, sits back down by Fairy Godmother and shushed]

Fairy Godmother: Mummy can handle this.. (continuing her son's rant) He endures blistering winds and scorching desert! He climbs to the highest bloody room of the tallest bloody tower!

King Harold: But, but, but...

Fairy Godmother: And what does he find? Some gender-confused wolf telling him that his princess--

King Harold: If I could just--

Fairy Godmother: --is already married!

King Harold: I mean, It wasn’t my fault. He didn’t get there in time.

Fairy Godmother: Stop the car!

[The carriage comes to a sudden stop]

Fairy Godmother: Harold...

[The men crack their knuckles]

Fairy Godmother: You force me to do something I really don’t want to do.

[Fairy Godmother rolls down the window]

King Harold: (gasps) Where are we?

[The carriage is stopped at a drive-thru window]

PRICILLA: Well, hi, there! Welcome to Friar’s Fat Boy, may I take your order?

Fairy Godmother: My diet is ruined! I hope you’re happy. (turns to the clerk) Er… okay. Two Renaissance Wraps, no mayo… chili ring...

Prince Charming: I’ll have the Medieval Meal.

Fairy Godmother: Yeah, one Medieval Meal and Harold… curly fries?

King Harold: No, thank you.

Fairy Godmother: Sourdough soft taco, then? What do you want?

King Harold: No, really, I’m fine.

PRICILLA: Your order, Fairy Godmother.

[The clerk hands her their order in a bad, and then a large battle-axe]

PRICILLA: And this comes with the Medieval Meal.

Fairy Godmother: There you are, dear.

[Fairy Godmother hands Prince Charming the axe. The carriage takes off]

Fairy Godmother: You see we made a deal, Harold, and I assume you don’t want me to go back on my part.

King Harold: (sighs) Indeed not.

Fairy Godmother: So Fiona and Charming will be together.

King Harold: Yes.

Fairy Godmother: Oh, believe me, Harold. It’s what’s best. Not only for your daughter…

[Fairy Godmother bites into her burrito and talks with her mouth full]

Fairy Godmother:...but for your Kingdom.

INT. - FAR FAR AWAY PALACE. MASTER BEDROOM.

[They arrive back at the balcony of the master bedroom and King Harold is pushed out]

King Harold: What am I supposed to do about it?

[The battle axe is tossed into King Harold's hands]

Fairy Godmother: Use your imagination.

[Fairy Godmother shuts the door and the carriage flies off. King Harold stands unsure, still clutching the axe, staring at the moon]

EXT. - THE POISON APPLE. NIGHT.

[A hooded man on horseback arrives at The Poison Apple, a ramshackle tavern. The man is King Harold in disguise. He dismounts his horse and enters the tavern. He knocks on the door and an eye peeks out]

CYCLOPS: Oh…uh come on in, Your Majesty.

[Cyclops opens the door and lets King Harold in]

INT. - THE POISON APPLE.

[The tavern is a seedy gathering of misfits. Pirates and witches sit at the tables. Two trees arm wrestle and two dwarfs fight. Someone is playing darts with throwing axes. Captain Hook plays the piano and sings. King Harold tries to hide his identity with his cloak and walks over to the bar. Next to him, the Headless Horseman downs a drink and burps. King Harold tries to get the attention of the bartender]

King Harold: (clears his throat) Um, excuse me?

[He turns to look down at a feminine frog sipping a martini on a stool]

Miss Frog: Hey. Do I know you?

King Harold: Uh, no, you must be mistaking me for someone else. Uh… excuse me. I’m looking for the Ugly Stepsister.

[The bartender turns around and leans on the bar, glaring at King Harold. It is Doris, otherwise known as the Ugly Stepsister]

King Harold: Ah! There you are. Right. You see, I...I need to have someone taken care of.

Doris: (in a deep voice) Who’s the guy?

King Harold: Well, he’s not a guy, per se. Um… he’s an ogre.

[The whole tavern gasps and Captain Hook stops playing]

Doris: Hey, buddy, let me clue you in. There’s only one fella who can handle a job like that, and, frankly…he don't like to be disturbed.

King Harold: Where could I find him?

[King Harold knocks on a door and lets himself in. The room is completely dark, except for the moonlight shining through a window. A shadowy figure sits with their boots on a table]

King Harold: H-Hello?

[A pair of bright green eyes appear from the darkness]

Puss in Boots: Who dares enter my room?

King Harold: Sorry! I hope I’m not interrupting, but I’m told you’re the one to talk to about an...ogre problem?

Puss in Boots: You are told correct, but for this I charge a great deal of money.

King Harold: Would… this be enough?

[King Harold tosses a small sack onto the table. Out from the shadows, a sword slices open the sack and gold coins spill out onto the table]

Puss in Boots: Hmm. You have engaged my valuable services...Your Majesty. Just tell me where I can find this ogre.

INT. - FAR FAR AWAY PALACE. FIONA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

[Shrek and Fiona lay in bed, which is just big enough to fit them both. Fiona is fast asleep while Shrek is awake, tossing and turning. He notices an ornate clock that features a prince and princess kissing, and then turns onto his back. He then stares at a poster of a handsome man named Sir Justin stuck to the bottom of the canopy above them. Shrek gets out of bed and looks out the window and stares at the Far Far Away sign. He goes over to the fireplace to warm up, but notices Fiona's childhood toys on the mantelpiece. One is a figure of a knight, who is about to slay a fallen ogre. Shrek picks up a toy princess that resembles Fiona and it speaks]

Princess Toy: Dear knight, I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude.

[Shrek puts the toy back and then looks over at a small chest on a table in the corner of the room. He opens it to see a book inside, but the box start playing music. He quickly shuts it and looks over to make sure Fiona is still sleeping. He quickly opens the box and snatches the book out from it. He opens it, and Fiona's voice reads it in his head]

Fiona: Dear Diary. Sleeping Beauty is having a slumber party tomorrow, but Dad says I can’t go. He never lets me out after sunset.

[He turns the page to the next entry in the diary]

Fiona: Dad says I’m going away for a while. Must be like some finishing school or something.

[He scoffs and turns the page]

Fiona: Mom says that when I’m old enough, my Handsome Prince Charming will rescue me from my tower and bring me back to my family!

[Turns the page]

Fiona: And we'll all live happily ever after!

[With his mouth open, Shrek turns to the next page]

Fiona: Mrs. Fiona Charming.

[He frantically turns the pages which all read aloud "Mrs. Fiona Charming". He is surprised by a knock at the door, and sets the diary down. He opens the door to see King Harold standing in the hall]

King Harold: Sorry. I hope I’m not interrupting anything.

Shrek: No, no. I was just reading a, uh…a scary book.

King Harold: I was hoping you’d let me apologize for my despicable behavior earlier.

Shrek: Okay?

King Harold: I don’t know what came over me. Do you suppose we could pretend it never happened and start over?

Shrek: Look, Your Majesty, I just…

King Harold: Please, call me Dad.

Shrek: Dad. We both acted like ogres. Maybe we just need some time to get to know each other.

King Harold: Excellent idea! I was actually hoping you might join me for a morning hunt. A little...father-son time? I know it would mean the world to Fiona.

[Shrek stares back at Fiona, still asleep, then sighs]

King Harold: Shall we say 7:30 by the old oak?

FOREST. DAY.

[Shrek and Donkey are walking through a thick forest. Far Far Palace is far off over the hills behind them]

Shrek: Face it, Donkey! We’re lost.

Donkey: We can’t be lost! We followed the king’s instructions exactly. What did he say? "Head to the darkest part of the woods…"

Shrek: Aye.

Donkey: "Past the sinister trees with those scary-looking branches."

Shrek: Check.

[Donkey runs over to a bush in the shape of a busty figure]

Donkey: Yeah, and there’s the bush shaped like Shirley Bassey!

Shrek: We passed that bush 3 times already!

Donkey: Hey, you were the one who said you didn't want to stop and get directions.

Shrek: Oh, great. My one chance to fix things up with Fiona’s dad, and I end up lost in the woods with you!

Donkey: Alright, you don’t have to get huffy with me, I’m only trying to help.

Shrek: I know! I know. (sighs) I’m sorry, all right?

Donkey: Hey, don’t worry about it.

Shrek: I just really need to make things work with this guy.

Donkey: Yeah, sure. Now let’s go bond with Daddy.

[Someone is looking at Shrek and Donkey from up in a tree. Purring sounds are heard]

Shrek: Well, well, well, Donkey. I know it was kind of a tender moment back there, but the purring?

Donkey: Man, what are you talking about? I ain’t purring.

Shrek: Oh, sure. What’s next? A hug?

Donkey: Hey, Shrek. Donkeys don’t purr. What do you think I am, some kind of a…

[A figure jumps down onto the path in front of them. It is an orange cat, wearing a hat, cape, boots, and brandishing a fencing sword]

Puss in Boots: Ha-ha! Fear me, if you dare! (hisses)

Shrek: Hey, look! A little cat.

Donkey: Look out, Shrek! He got a piece!

Shrek: It’s a cat, Donkey. Come here, little kitty, kitty. Come on, little kitty. Come here. Oh! Come here, little kitty.

[Puss in Boots throws off his cape, sticks his sword into the ground, and leaps towards Shrek. With his claws drawn he grabs onto Shrek's leg. Shrek screams in pain]

Donkey: Hold on, Shrek! I’m coming!

[Puss in Boots is climbing all over Shrek and gets into his clothes]

Shrek: Come on! Oh, get it off! Oh, get it off! Oh, God. Oh… No! Ooh! Aagh!

[Puss in Boots comes ripping out the front of Shrek's shirt, and then digs his claws into his leg again]

Donkey: Look out, Shrek! Hold still!

Shrek: Get it off!

Donkey: Shrek! Hold still!

[Donkey tries to kick Puss in Boots with his hind legs, but Puss dodges and accidentally kicks Shrek in the crotch. Shrek drops to his knees and clutches the area]

Donkey: Did I miss?

Shrek: No. You got them.

[Puss in Boots leaps back over them, cartwheeling in the air, lands back in his boots and picks up his hat and sword]

Puss in Boots: Now, ye ogre, pray for mercy from… Puss…in Boots!

[He cuts a letter P mark in a tree, similar to Zorro]

Shrek: (infuriated) Ohh, I’ll kill that cat!

Puss in Boots: Ah-ha-ha!

[Puss in Boots starts coughing and then heaving onto the floor. Shrek and Donkey stand confused until Puss finally spits out a hairball]

Puss in Boots: (chuckles) Hairball.

Donkey: Oh! That is nasty!

[Shrek picks Puss in Boots up by the scruff]

Shrek: What do you reckon we should do with him?

Donkey: I say we take the sword and neuter him right here. Give him the Bob Barker treatment!?

Puss in Boots: (frightened) Oh, no! Por favor! Please! I implore you! It was nothing personal, Señor! I was doing it only for my family. My mother, she is sick. And my father lives off the garbage! The king offered me much in gold and I have a litter of brothers…

[Shrek covers Puss in Boots' mouth with his finger]

Shrek: Whoa...whoa...whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Fiona’s father paid you to do this?

Puss in Boots: The rich King? Sí.

[Shrek drops Puss in Boots to the ground and he screeches]

Shrek: Well, so much for Dad’s royal blessing.

Donkey: Oh, come on, Shrek, don’t feel bad. Almost everybody that meets you wants to kill you.

[Shrek sits down on a nearby rock, looking down]

Shrek: Gee, thanks. (sighs) Maybe Fiona would’ve been better off if I were some sort of Prince Charming.

Puss in Boots: Sí, that’s what the King said.

[Donkey glares at Puss in Boots]

Puss in Boots: Oh, uh… sorry. I thought that question was directed at me.

Donkey: Shrek, Fiona knows you’d do anything for her.

Shrek: Well, it’s not like I wouldn’t change if I could. I just… I just wish I could make her happy. [tiny pauses out] Hold the phone…

[Shrek pulls out the business card he took from Fairy Godmother earlier. He reads it]

Shrek: "Happiness. A tear drop away." Donkey! Think of the saddest thing that’s ever happened to you.

Donkey: Aw, man, where do I begin? Well, first there was the time that old farmer tried to sell me for some magic beans. I ain't never got over that. Then this fool went off and had a party and he have the guests trying to pin the tail on me. Then they got all drunk and start beating me with a stick going, "Piñata! Piñata!" What is a piñata, anyway?!

Shrek: No, Donkey! I need you to cry!

Donkey: Yeah, well don’t go projecting on me! I know you’re feeling bad, but you gotta let your own--

[Puss in Boots forcefully steps on Donkey's hoof. Donkey screams in pain]

Donkey: You little, hairy, litter-licking sack of...

[Donkey sheds a tear, and Shrek lets it fall onto the card. A bubble is conjured, and Fairy Godmother appears in it]

Fairy Godmother: What? Is it on? Is it on? [clears throat] This is Fairy Godmother. I’m either away from my desk or with a client. But if you come by the office, we’ll be glad to make you a personal appointment. Have a happy ever after.

[The bubble bursts into sparkling dust]

Donkey: Oh…

Shrek: Are you up for a little quest, Donkey?

Donkey: That’s more like it! Shrek and Donkey, on another whirlwind adventure! Ain’t no stopping us now! Whoo! We’re on the move!

[Shrek and Donkey start walking off]

Puss in Boots: Stop, Ogre! I have misjudged you.

Shrek: Join the club. We’ve got jackets.

Puss in Boots: On my honor, I am obliged to accompany you until I have saved your life as you have spared me mine.

Donkey: I'm sorry, the position of annoying talking animals has already been taken. Let’s go, Shrek! Shrek?

[Shrek looks down at Puss in Boots, who gives him a cute, helpless look. Shrek smiles]

Donkey: Shrek!

Shrek: Aw, come on, Donkey. Look at him… in his wee little boots. You know, how many cats can wear boots? Honestly. Aw, let’s keep him!

Donkey: Say what?!

[Puss purrs and Shrek marvels at his cuteness]

[Donkey groans]

[Shrek scoops him up into his arms and begins walking with Donkey]

Shrek: Aw, listen. He’s purring!

Donkey: Oh, so now it’s cute!

Shrek: Aw, come on, Donkey. Lighten up.

Donkey: Lighten up? Oh, I should lighten up?! Look who’s telling who to lighten up!

INT. - FAR FAR AWAY PALACE. FIONA'S BEDROOM. MORNING.

[Fiona is awaken by the puppy licking her nose]

Fiona: [giggles] Shrek!

[She looks up and the dog barks. She sits up with a concerned look on her face]

Fiona: Shrek?

[She gets up and walks to the balcony, only to notice the diary opened face down. She picks it up to a page of a drawing of Fiona and a prince kissing]

EXT. - FAR FAR AWAY PALACE. MORNING.

[King Harold and Queen Lillian are with servants outside in a courtyard, looking at different samples of carpet. King Harold looks distracted]

Queen Lillian: They’re both festive, aren’t they? What do you think, Harold?

King Harold: Um… yes, yes. Fine. Fine.

[Queen Lillian scoffs and sends the servants away]

Queen Lillian: Try to at least pretend you’re interested in your daughter’s wedding ball.

King Harold: Honestly, Lillian, I don’t think it matters. How do we know there will even be a ball?

[Fiona steps out from the palace doors]

Fiona: Mom! Dad!

Queen Lillian: Oh, hello, dear.

King Harold: What’s that, Cedric? Right! Coming!

[King Harold walks off before Fiona reaches them]

Fiona: Mom, have you seen Shrek?

Queen Lillian: I haven’t. You should ask your father. Be sure and use small words, dear. He’s a little slow this morning.

[King Harold walks up to Cedric, a servant, who is carrying a bowl]

Cedric: Can I help you, Your Majesty?

King Harold: Ah, yes! Um…

[King Harold sticks his finger into the bowl and tastes it]

King Harold: Mmm! Exquisite. What do you call this dish?

Cedric: That would be the dog’s breakfast, Your Majesty.

King Harold: Ah, yes. Very good, then. Carry on, Cedric.

[Fiona catches up and Cedric walks away]

Fiona: Dad? Dad, have you seen Shrek?

King Harold: Uh, no I haven’t, dear.

[King Harold walks off again, going up to servants and trying to appear busy]

King Harold: I’m sure he just went off to look for a nice… mud hole to cool down in. You know, after your little spat last night.

Fiona: Oh. You heard that, huh?

[King Harold continues to walk away but Fiona keeps up]

King Harold: Darling, the whole kingdom heard you. I mean, after all, it is in his nature to be…well, a bit of a brute.

Fiona: Him? You know, you didn’t exactly roll out the Welcome Wagon!

King Harold: Well, what did you expect?! Look at what he’s done to you.

Fiona: Shrek loves me for who I am. I would think you’d be happy for me.

King Harold: Darling, I’m just thinking about what’s best for you. Maybe you should do the same.

[King Harold leaves and leaves Fiona standing]

FOREST

[Donkey is walking behind Shrek, who is still carrying Puss in Boots. Donkey eyes Puss in Boots suspiciously as he whispers into Shrek's ear. Shrek glances back at Donkey]

Shrek: No, really?

[Shrek and Puss in Boots laugh. They walk out into a clearing]

Donkey: Oh…

EXT. - FAIRY GODMOTHER'S COTTAGE

[Off in the distance they see a small cottage. Connected to it is a giant factory with colored gases rising out from its chimneys]

Donkey: Oh, no. That’s the ol' Keebler’s place! Let’s just back away slowly.

Puss in Boots: That’s the Fairy Godmother’s cottage. She’s the largest producer of hexes and potions in the whole kingdom.

Shrek: Then why don’t we pop in there for a spell? Ha-ha! Spell!

[Shrek chuckles while Puss in Boots laughs loudly and they walk on. With an annoyed look on his face, Donkey follows them]

Puss in Boots: He makes me laugh!

INT. - FAIRY GODMOTHER'S COTTAGE

[The three enter through the front door of the cottage and into a reception area. At the desk sits an elf writing into a book]

Shrek: Hi. I’m here to see the--

Jerome: The Fairy Godmother. I’m sorry. She is not in.

[Fairy Godmother's voice sounds from a speaker system next to the receptionist]

Fairy Godmother: Jerome, coffee and a Monte Cristo. Now!

Jerome: [sighs] Yes, Fairy Godmother. Right away. Look, she’s not seeing any clients today, okay?

Shrek: That’s okay, buddy. We’re from the union.

Jerome: The union?

Shrek: We represent the workers in all magical industries, both evil and benign.

Jerome: Oh! Oh, right.

Shrek: Are you feeling at all degraded or oppressed?

[Jerome turns the speaker to face the other way]

Jerome: Uh… a little. W--w--we don’t even have dental.

Shrek: They don’t even have dental. Okay, we're just gonna have a look around. Oh. By the way. I think it’d be better if the Fairy Godmother didn’t know we were here. Know what I’m saying? Huh?

Donkey: Hmm?

Shrek: Huh?

Donkey: Huh? Huh? Huh?!

Shrek: Stop it.

Jerome: (whispers) Of course. Go right in.

[The three walk through a door next to the receptionist]

INT. - POTION FACTORY

[From up above on a catwalk, the three look out at the factory. The workers are all elves wearing white hazmat suits. Chemicals are poured into giant vats. Potions are put onto conveyor belts. Ingredients are tested and mixed. Shrek notices a set of doors at the other end of the room with a sign above that reads "Potion Room". They see flashing lights accompanied by booming sounds coming from a doorway to their right. They head inside and walk down a hallway, which leads to another set of doors. They can hear Fairy Godmother behind it as well as the source of the flashes]

Fairy Godmother: A drop of desire! [giggles] Naughty!

[Inside a giant cauldron pours out gas as Fairy Godmother dumps various vials into it]

Fairy Godmother: A pinch of passion. [laughs] And just a hint of…lust! [laughs]

Shrek: Excuse me.

[Shrek and company walk in, and Fairy Godmother gasps]

Shrek: Sorry to barge in like this but uh--

Fairy Godmother: What in Grimm’s name are you doing here?

Shrek: Well...it seems that Fiona’s not exactly happy.

Fairy Godmother: Oh-ho-ho! And there’s some question as to why that is? Well, let’s explore that, shall we?

[Fairy Godmother hovers over to wall of bookshelves filled with books]

Fairy Godmother: Ah. P, P, P, P, P…Princess.

[She pulls out a book titled "Cinderella"]

Fairy Godmother: Cinderella! Here we are. "Lived happily ever after." Oh…[laughs] No ogres!

[She tosses the book to the ground and pulls out another]

Fairy Godmother: Let’s see. Snow White. A handsome prince. Oh...no ogres.

[She continues to pull out books and toss them]

Fairy Godmother: Sleeping Beauty. Oh, no ogres! Hansel and Gretel? No! Thumbelina? No. The Golden Bird, the Little Mermaid, Pretty Woman…No, no, no, no, no!

[She flies down and gets in Shrek's face]

Fairy Godmother: You see, ogres don’t live happily ever after.

[Shrek points his finger at Fairy Godmother]

Shrek: All right, look, lady!

Fairy Godmother: Don’t you point… those dirty green sausages at me!

[They get closer towards each other and glare into each other's eyes. They are interrupted by a worker who comes through the door]

Worker: Your Monte Cristo and coffee--oh! Sorry.

Shrek: Ah… that’s okay. We were just leaving. Very sorry to have wasted your time, Miss Godmother.

Fairy Godmother: Just… go.

Shrek: Come on, guys.

[The three head back out the doors. A worker pushing a cart walks by the janitor's closet. It opens and Shrek pulls him and the cart inside. Shrek puts the hazmat suit on which only manages to cover his head. He walks through the factory floor pushing the cart]

Shrek: TGIF, eh, buddy? Working hard or hardly working, eh, Mac?

[He enters the Potion Room he saw earlier. He opens the cart to reveal Donkey and Puss in Boots crammed inside]

Puss in Boots: Oh! Eh!

Donkey: Hey, man, you wanna get your fine Corinthian footwear and your cat cheeks out of my face? Man, that stinks!

Puss in Boots: Well, you don’t exactly smell like a basket of roses.

[Shrek looks up at the shelves built into the walls around them. The shelves are filled with different potions]

Shrek: Well, one of these has got to help.

Puss in Boots: Ah, I was just concocting this very plan. Already our minds are becoming one.

Donkey: Whoa, whoa, whoa, now. Listen, if we need an expert on licking ourselves, we’ll give you a call. Shrek, this is a bad idea.

Shrek: Look. Make yourself useful and go keep watch. Puss, do you think you could get to those on top?

Puss in Boots: No problema, boss. In one of my 9 lives I was the great cat burglar of Santiago de Compostela! (laughs)

Donkey: Shrek, are you off your nut?

Shrek: Donkey, keep watch.

Donkey: Keep watch? Yeah, Imma keep watch. I’ll watch that wicked witch come and whammy zammy a world of hurt all up your backside. I'm gonna laugh, too. I’ll be giggling to myself.

[Donkey walks back the door to stand on guard. Puss in Boots climbs up the shelves and stops at a glowing green vial]

Shrek: What do you see?

Puss in Boots: "Toad Stool Softener"?

Donkey: Oh yeah, right, I’m sure a nice BM is the perfect solution for marital problems!

[Puss in Boots continues to climb up and stop every so often]

Puss in Boots: "Elfa Seltzer"?

Shrek: Uh-uh.

Puss in Boots: "Hex Lax"?

Shrek: No! Try "handsome."

Puss in Boots: Sorry. No handsome.

[Puss in Boots stops at a row of potions kept behind a glass display case]

Puss in Boots: Hey! How about "Happily Ever After"?

Shrek: Well, what does it do?

Puss in Boots: It says "Beauty Divine."

Donkey: You know in some cultures, donkeys are revered as the wisest of all creatures. Especially us talking ones.

[Donkey, not paying attention to the door, doesn't notice a worker and Jerome staring at them]

Shrek: [gasps] Donkey!

[Donkey looks back and Jerome and the worker run off. Donkey runs back to Shrek and the door shuts]

Shrek: That’ll have to do. We’ve got company!

[Puss in Boots uses his claw to cut a hole in the glass]

Donkey: Can we get on with this?

[Puss in Boots tries to pull out the Happily Ever After potion, but the hole he made is too small for it to fit]

Shrek: Hurry!

[Puss in Boots tries to force the potion through and the glass starts to crack. It shatters as the bottle is pulled out, sending Puss in Boots flying. Donkey manage to catch the falling potion with his mouth]

Shrek: Nice catch, Donkey!

[Puss in Boots lands on his feet]

Puss in Boots: Finally! A good use for your mouth.

[An alarm sounds and red lights flash. At the doorway, a metal gate starts to lower down]

Shrek: Come on!

[Shrek grabs Donkey and Puss in Boots and dives under the gate. Puss in Boots reaches back for his hat just before the gate slams shut. A group of elves run in with rapid-fire crossbows and shoot at them. Shrek, still carrying Donkey and Puss in Boots, dodges the arrows and jumps onto a conveyer belt. They continue to dodge the arrows as they climb over various wooden machinery. Shrek tips over a giant cauldron, filled with a potion, and the substance spills onto the floor. The elves run away as Shrek jumps up and grabs onto a pulley system that leads back to the entrance. The potion splashes over a cage of two geese and turns them into ballerinas. Two workers are caught in it and are transformed into a clock and a candelabra. Another group of fleeing elves are turned into doves. Shrek, Donkey, and Puss in Boots reach the end of the room and jump onto the catwalk. Later, the potion has dried up and Fairy Godmother shouts at the doves]

Fairy Godmother: I don’t care whose fault it is. Just get this place cleaned up!

Doves: Yes, Godmother.

Fairy Godmother: And somebody bring me something deep fried and smothered in chocolate!

[Prince Charming comes bursting through the doors behind her]

Prince Charming: Mother!

Fairy Godmother: Charming. Sweetheart. Well, this isn’t a good time, pumpkin. Mama’s working.

Prince Charming: Whoa, what happened here?

Fairy Godmother: The ogre, that’s what!

Prince Charming: What?! Where is he, Mom?

[Prince Charming pulls his sword out from its sheath and starts swinging it around]

Prince Charming: I shall rend his head from his shoulders! I will smite him where he stands! He will rue the very day he stole my kingdom from me!

[Bird poop lands on his shoulder]

Prince Charming: Oh, put it away, Junior! You’re still going to be king. We’ll just have to come up with something smarter.

[Jerome, who is now a dove, flies over carrying a clipboard]

Jerome: Pardon. Um…e-everything is accounted for, Fairy Godmother. Except for one potion.

[Fairy Godmother takes a look at the clipboard]

Fairy Godmother: What? Oh… I do believe we can make this work to our advantage.

FOREST - DAY

[Shrek, Donkey, and Puss in Boots are walking through a clearing. Shrek reads the label on the potion]

Shrek: "Happily Ever After Potion. Maximum strength. For you and your true love. If one of you drinks this, you both will be fine. Happiness, comfort and beauty divine."

Donkey: "You both will be fine"?

Shrek: I guess it means it’ll affect Fiona, too.

[Shrek pops the cork out from the bottle]

Donkey: Hey, man, this don’t feel right. My donkey senses are tingling all over. So why don't you just drop that jug o’ voodoo and let’s get out of here.

Shrek: It says, "Beauty Divine." How bad can it be?

[Shrek sniffs the potion and sneezes onto a mushroom]

Donkey: Aha! See, you’re allergic to that stuff. You’re gonna have a reaction. And if you think that I’ll be smearing VapoRub all over your chest, think again!

Puss in Boots: Boss, just in case there is something wrong with the potion… allow me to take the first sip. It would be an honor to lay my life on the line for you.

Donkey: Oh, no, no. I don’t think so. If there's gonna be any animal testing, I’m gonna do it. That’s the best friend’s job. Now give me that bottle.

[Donkey grabs the bottle with his mouth and chugs half of it down. Shrek grabs the bottle]

Shrek: How do you feel?

Donkey: Well, I don’t feel any different. I look any different?

Puss in Boots: You still look like an ass to me.

Shrek: Maybe it doesn’t work on donkeys. Well, here’s to us, Fiona.

Donkey: Shrek? You drink that, there’s no going back.

Shrek: I know.

Donkey: But, no more wallowing in the mud?

Shrek: I know.

Donkey: No more itchy butt crack?

Shrek: I know!

Donkey: But you love being an ogre!

Shrek: I know! (sighs) But I love Fiona more.

Donkey: Shrek, no! Wait!

[Shrek drinks the rest of the potion. His belly starts rumbling, and Donkey and Puss in Boots take cover behind a log. Shrek lets out a loud fart and the two come out from cover]

Donkey: Ooh, got to be… I think you grabbed the "Farty Ever After" potion.

Puss in Boots: Maybe it’s a dud.

Shrek: Or maybe Fiona and I were never meant to be.

[Suddenly, thunder sounds and gray clouds move in above them]

Donkey: Uh-oh. What did I tell you? I think I feel something coming on. I don’t want to die. I don’t want to die. I don’t want to die!

[It starts raining]

Donkey: Oh, sweet sister, mother of mercy. I’m melting! I’m melting!

Shrek: It’s just the rain, Donkey.

Donkey: [chuckles] Oh.

[As they walk off, they don't notice the mushroom Shrek sneezed on transform into a rose. They eventually come across an abandoned barn in the forest. Shrek opens the gates and they head inside]

EXT. - ABANDONED BARN

[Shrek looks out from the barn, solemnly starting at Far Far Away way off in the distance. Shrek looks down at Donkey and pats his head]

Donkey: Shrek, don’t worry. Things seem bad because it’s dark and rainy and Fiona’s father hired a sleazy hitman to whack you.

[Puss in Boots hisses at Donkey]

Donkey: lt’ll be better in the morning. You’ll see. The sun’ll come out…tomorrow. [yawns] Bet your bottom…

Shrek: Bet my bottom?

Donkey: I’m coming, Elizabeth!

[Donkey rears back and falls to the floor unconscious]

Shrek: Donkey? Are you all right?

Puss in Boots: Hey, boss. Let’s shave him.

Shrek: D-Donkey?..

[Shrek passes out and falls down. Puss screeches]

INT. - FAR FAR AWAY PALACE

[King Harold and Queen Lillian are sitting by a fireplace when Fiona walks in]

King Harold: There you are! We missed you at dinner.

Queen Lillian: What is it, darling?

Fiona: Dad…I’ve been thinking about what you said. And I’m going to set things right.

King Harold: Ah! Excellent! That’s my girl.

Fiona: It was a mistake to bring Shrek here. I’m going to go out and find him. And then we're gonna go back to the swamp where we belong.

[Fiona walks out of the room and grabs her suitcase. King Harold and Queen Lillian follow her]

Queen Lillian: Fiona, please!

King Harold: Let’s not be rash, darling. You can’t go anywhere right now.

[Fiona pushes open the front doors of the palace and looks out at the rain. Before she can step forward, she passes out and falls to the floor]

King Harold: Fiona!

Queen Lillian: Fiona!

[King Harold and Queen Lillian run over to Fiona and kneel over her]

INT. - ABANDONED BARN

[Posed similarly, Puss in Boots runs over to Shrek and Donkey's unconscious bodies. He lies down beside them]

EXT. - ABANDONED BARN

[We see a bright, sparkling purple light emit from the barn. It fades]

INT. - FAR FAR AWAY PALACE. FIONA'S CHILDHOOD ROOM.

[King Harold and Queen Lillian tend to Fiona, who they have tucked into bed. Queen Lillian walks off, and King Harold follows after lingering for a few moments]

EXT. - FAR FAR AWAY PALACE. FIONA'S CHILDHOOD ROOM.

[A similar bright light flashes in Fiona's room before fading]

INT. - ABANDONED BARN. MORNING.

[Eyes slowly open. Women can be heard whispering]

Maiden #2: Look look look, I told you he was here. Look at him! Look at him!

Maiden #1: Shh! Quiet!

Maiden #2: Look at him!

[Shrek groans. A woman laying down, staring at him, comes into focus]

Jill: Good morning, sleepyhead.

[Shrek shouts and sits up. Three women are sitting beside him, and one of them is holding Puss in Boots in her arms]

Jill & Maidens: Good morning!

Maiden #2: We love your kitty!

Shrek: Oww…my head…

Jill: Here, I fetched a pail of water.

Shrek: Thanks.

[Shrek looks at down at his hands and gasps, noticing they are now human hands. He grabs the pail of water and looks at his reflection. He is now a handsome, human man. He gasps and drops the pail onto the floor. He starts to feel his new body]

Shrek: Oh!.. A cute, button nose? Thick, wavy locks? Taut, round buttocks?! I’m… I’m…

[Jill and Maiden #1 latch onto Shrek]

Jill: Gorgeous!

Maiden #1: I’ll say.

Jill: I’m Jill. What’s your name?

Shrek: Um… Shrek.

Jill: "Shrek"? Wow...are you from Europe?

Maiden #1: You’re so tense!

Jill: I want to rub his shoulders.

Maiden #1: I got it covered, thanks.

[Maiden #2 joins in]

Maiden #2: I don’t have anything to rub!

Jill: Well, get in line.

Shrek: Have you ladies seen my donkey?

Donkey: Who are you calling donkey?!

[Donkey stands in the doorway. He is now a white stallion]

Shrek: Donkey? You’re a--

Donkey: A stallion, baby! I can whinny! [whinnies] I can count!

[Donkey starts to trot around outside]

Donkey: Look at me, Shrek! I’m...trotting! That’s some quality potion! What’s in that stuff?

Puss in Boots: "Oh, don’t take the potion, Mr. Boss, it’s very bad." Pah!

[Puss in Boots picks up the discarded potion bottle and reads the label]

Puss in Boots: "Warning: Side effects may include burning, itching, oozing, weeping. Not intended for heart patients or those with… nervous disorders."

Donkey: I’m trotting, I’m trotting in place! Yeah!

[Shrek, Puss in Boots, Jill and the maidens all stare at Donkey]

Donkey: What?

Puss in Boots: Señor!

[Puss in Boots reads the rest of the label]

Puss in Boots: "To make the effects of this potion permanent, the drinker must obtain his true love’s kiss by midnight."

[Shrek grabs the potion to read it for himself]

Shrek: Midnight?! Why is it always midnight?

Maiden #1: Oh! Pick me! I’ll be your true love!

Jill: I’ll be your true love.

Maiden #2: I’ll be true... enough.

[Jill and the maidens start puckering their lips and Shrek backs away]

Shrek: Look, ladies, I already have a true love.

[The women groan in disappointment]

Puss in Boots: And take it from me, boss. You are going to have one satisfied princess.

Donkey: And let’s face it. You are a lot easier on the eyes. But inside you’re the still same old, mean, salty…

Shrek: Easy--

Donkey: …cantankerous, stinky...

Shrek: Alright then--

Donkey: …foul, angry ogre you always been.

Shrek: And you’re still the same annoying donkey.

Donkey: Yeah.

Shrek: Well, look out, princess. Here comes the new me!

[Shrek's pants fall down to his ankles. His clothes are too big for him now]

Donkey: First things first, we need to get you out of those clothes.

[The women all gasp in excitement]

FOREST. MORNING.

[A carriage is traveling on a road through the forest. Shrek, Donkey, and Puss in Boots are hidden further up the road]

Shrek: Ready?

Donkey: Ready!

[The carriage hits a bump and Donkey screams behind them. A passenger inside the carriage leans out his head]

Nobleman: Driver, stop!

[The nobleman gets out to examine Donkey, who is writhing on the ground]

Donkey: Oh, God! Help me, please! My racing days are over! I’m blind! I’m blind! Tell the truth, will I ever play the violin again?

Nobleman: Oh, you poor creature! Is there anything I can do for you?

Donkey: Well, I guess there is one thing...

[Donkey drops the act and Puss in Boots jumps out from behind him, pointing his sword at the nobleman]

Puss in Boots: Take off the powdered wig and step away from your drawers!

[Shrek puts on the nobleman's powdered wig and his clothes, which are too small for him]

Puss in Boots: Not bad.

Donkey: Not bad at all.

[After a moment of silence, the two burst out laughing. The nobleman's son peeks out from inside the carriage]

Nobleman's son: Father? Is everything all right, Father?

[The son gets a look at the scene and tries to hide back inside. Shrek takes his clothes, leaving both the nobleman and his son stranded in their undergarments. Shrek saddles up on Donkey's back with Puss in Boots]

Shrek: Thank you, gentlemen! Someday, I will repay you! Unless, of course, I can't find you or if I forget.

[Donkey whinnies and rears back onto his hind legs, knocking Puss in Boots off. Donkey sprints off, leaving Puss in Boots muttering angrily in Spanish]

Puss in Boots: Ey tú! Pedazo de carne con patas, cómo te atreves hacerme esto?! (Subtitled: "Hey you! You piece of meat with legs, how dare you do this to me?!)

KINGDOM OF FAR FAR AWAY. DAY.

[Shrek and Puss in Boots are riding Donkey through the streets of Far Far Away. Shrek looks uneasy as people in the streets stop and stare. Shrek cautiously waves at an angry mob, who to his surprise, smile and wave back at him. Shrek admires the new "him" in the mirror and waves at three noblewomen ogling at him. Donkey kicks into a faster pace and towards the Far Far Away Palace.]

EXT. - FAR FAR AWAY PALACE. DAY.

[They stop at the foot of the stairs leading up to the palace doors. Two guards stand by the stairs]

Guard: Halt!

Shrek: Tell Princess Fiona her husband, Sir Shrek, is here to see her.

INT. - FAR FAR AWAY PALACE. FIONA'S CHILDHOOD ROOM.

[Fiona gest out of bed and walks over to the mirror to wash her face. As she takes the towel away from her face, she sees her reflection in the mirror; she is a human again. She screams and Shrek hears her from outside]

Shrek: Fiona!

Fiona: Shrek?

INT. - FAR FAR AWAY PALACE.

[Shrek runs inside the palace to find Fiona. Fiona runs out of her room to do the same. The two almost cross each other's paths]

INT. - FAR FAR AWAY PALACE. FIONA'S CHILDHOOD ROOM.

[Shrek runs into Fiona's room and sees a cloaked figure hovering by the window]

Shrek: Fiona?

[The figure takes off the cloak and reveals themselves to be Fairy Godmother]

Fairy Godmother: Hello, handsome.

EXT. - FAR FAR AWAY PALACE.

[Fiona runs outside and down the stairs, not recognizing Donkey in his new form]

Fiona: Shrek!

Donkey: Princess!

Fiona: Donkey?

Donkey: Wow! That potion worked on you too, huh?

Fiona: What potion?

Donkey: Oh, it's kind of a long story but, see, Shrek and I took some magic potion. And well, now...we’re sexy!

[Fiona leans over to see Puss in Boots sitting on Donkey's back]

Fiona: Shrek?

Puss in Boots: For you, baby… I could be.

Donkey: Yeah, you wish.

Fiona: Donkey, where is Shrek?

Donkey: He just went inside looking for you.

INT. - FAR FAR AWAY PALACE.

[Fiona runs back inside and yells loudly]

Fiona: Shrek!

INT. - FAR FAR AWAY PALACE. FIONA'S CHILDHOOD ROOM.

Shrek: Fiona! Fiona!

[Shrek runs for the door, but Fairy Godmother uses her magic to close it. One of the talking pieces of furniture from before moves in his way]

Furniture: You want to dance, pretty boy?

[Shrek tries to run out to the balcony, but Fairy Godmother shuts those doors as well]

Fairy Godmother: Are you going so soon? Don’t you want to see your wife?

[Fairy Godmother gestures to the window and steps aside]

INT. - FAR FAR AWAY PALACE.

[Elsewhere in the palace, Fiona stops at the top of some stairs. She hears a voice come from a room to her right]

Prince Charming: Fiona?

[Fiona steps toward the voice and sees Prince Charming standing by a balcony. He is wearing noble clothes that somewhat resemble Shrek's usual getup]

Fiona: Shrek?

Prince Charming: Aye, Fiona. It is me.

Fiona: What happened to your voice?

Prince Charming: Uhh...the potion changed a lot of things, Fiona. But not the way I feel about you.

[Just as Prince Charming takes Fiona's hand, King Harold and Queen Lillian come walking in]

Queen Lillian: Fiona?

King Harold: Charming?!

Prince Charming: Ah--do you think so? [laughs] Dad. I was so hoping you would approve.

Queen Lillian: Um… Who are you?

Prince Charming: Mom, it’s me, Shrek. I know you never get a second chance at a first impression, but, well, what do you think?

[Prince Charming pulls Fiona in closer, who is still looking at him with suspicion. Neither King Harold nor Queen Lillian appear to be approving. Prince Charming hugs Fiona, who hesitantly obliges him. Shrek is shouting from across the other side of the palace in Fiona's room. The glass window muffles his voice and none of them can hear him]

Shrek: Fiona! Fiona!

INT. - FAR FAR AWAY PALACE. FIONA'S CHILDHOOD ROOM.

Shrek: Fiona! Fiona!

Fairy Godmother: Fiona, Fiona! Ho-ho-ho-oh, shoot! I don’t think they can hear us, pigeon.

[Shrek stares out at the coupe and sighs]

Fairy Godmother: Don’t you think you’ve already messed her life up enough?

Shrek: I just wanted her to be happy.

Fairy Godmother: And now she can be. Oh, sweetheart. She’s finally found the prince of her dreams.

Shrek: But look at me. Look what I’ve done for her.

Fairy Godmother: It’s time you stop living in a fairy tale, Shrek. She’s a princess, and you’re an ogre. That’s something no amount of potion will ever change.

[Shrek takes another look out the window and sees Fiona, Prince Charming, King Harold, and Queen Lillian head inside from the balcony]

Shrek: But…I love her.

Fairy Godmother: If you really love her…you’ll let her go.

EXT. - FAR FAR AWAY PALACE.

[Shrek comes from out of the palace, angrily barging down the stairs]

Donkey: Shrek?

Puss in Boots: Señor?

[Shrek walks by without looking at them]

Donkey: Hey, what’s going on? Where are you going?

INT. - FAR FAR AWAY PALACE.

[Prince Charming and Fiona walk down the hallway away from King Harold and Queen Lillian. Fiona looks back and gives King Harold a confused look before Prince Charming nudges her closer]

Queen Lillian: You wouldn’t have had anything to do with this...would you, Harold?

[King Harold looks down with a guilty look on his face]

EXT. - KINGDOM OF FAR FAR AWAY.

[Shrek walks through the streets with his head bowed down. Donkey and Puss in Boots follow him]

INT. - POISON APPLE.

[Captain Hook is playing the piano and singing. Shrek, Donkey, and Puss in Boots are sitting at the bar with their drinks. Doris sets a bottle of milk on the table]

Doris: There you go, boys.

Puss in Boots: Just leave the bottle, Doris.

Doris: Hey. Why the long face?

Shrek: It was all just a stupid mistake. I never should have rescued her from that tower in the first place.

[Puss in Boots laps up the milk in his cup and slams it down]

Puss in Boots: I hate Mondays.

Donkey: I can’t believe you’d walk away from the best thing that ever happened to you.

Shrek: What choice do I have? She loves that pretty boy, Prince Charming.

Donkey: Aww, come on. Is he really that good-looking?

Doris: Are you kidding? He’s gorgeous! He has a face that looks like it was carved by angels.

Puss in Boots: Oh. He sounds dreamy.

Shrek: You know, shockingly, this isn’t making me feel any better. Look, guys. It’s for the best. Mom and Dad approve, and Fiona gets the man she’s always dreamed of. Everybody wins.

[Behind them, King Harold enters inside wearing his cloak]

Donkey: Except for you. I don’t get it, Shrek. You love Fiona.

Shrek: Aye. And that’s why I have to let her go.

King Harold: Umm...excuse me, is she here?

[Shrek looks up to see King Harold who is talking with Doris]

Doris: She’s, uh… in the back.

[King Harold walks up to a door in the back and sees Fairy Godmother's men from before standing guard]

King Harold: Oh, hello again. Heh...

[He goes through the doors]

INT. - POISON APPLE. BACK ROOM.

[Fairy Godmother and Prince Charming stand waiting inside the room]

King Harold: Fairy Godmother. Charming.

Fairy Godmother: Ugh, you’d better have a good reason for dragging us down here, Harold.

King Harold: Well, I’m afraid Fiona isn’t really…warming up to Prince Charming.

Prince Charming: Umm, F-Y-I, not my fault.

Fairy Godmother: Oh, no, no, of course it’s not, dear.

Prince Charming: I mean, how charming can I be when I have to pretend I’m that dreadful ogre?

King Harold: No, no, it’s nobody’s fault. Perhaps it’s best if we just call the whole thing off, okay?

Fairy Godmother & Prince Charming: What?!

King Harold: I mean you can’t force someone to fall in love!

Fairy Godmother: Oh, I beg to differ. I do it all the time.

[Fairy Godmother pulls out a red vial and hands it to King Harold. Shrek is listening in from the window, outside and out of sight]

Fairy Godmother: Have Fiona drink this and she’ll fall in love with the first man she kisses, which will be Charming.

King Harold: Umm… no.

Fairy Godmother: What did you say?

King Harold: I...I...I can’t. I...I won’t do it.

Fairy Godmother: Oh, yes, you will. If you remember, I helped you with your happily ever after. And I can take it away just as easily.

[Fairy Godmother sticks her wand in King Harold's face and it begins to glow]

Fairy Godmother: Is that what you want? Is it?

King Harold: No.

Fairy Godmother: Good boy. Now, we have to go. I need to do Charming’s hair before the ball. He’s hopeless. You know he’s all high in the front, he can never get to the back. You always need someone to do the back of your hair.

Prince Charming: Oh! Thank you, Mother.

Donkey: Mother?!

[The three look out the window to see Shrek, Donkey, and Puss in Boots standing at the window]

Shrek: Um… Mary! A talking horse!

Fairy Godmother: The ogre!

EXT. - THE POISON APPLE. DAY.

[Outside by the entrance, a pair of guards are interrogating the Headless Horseman. Shrek and Puss in Boots ride Donkey and sprint past them. Fairy Godmother comes flying after them]

Fairy Godmother: Stop them! Thieves! Bandits! Stop them!

[Fairy Godmother tries to zap them as the guards start running after them]

EXT. - FAR FAR AWAY PALACE. EVENING.

[Fireworks go off in the evening sky. The red carpet is rolled out in front of the palace and festivities are set up. Crowds of people are gathered by the red carpet as celebrities walk down it]

Announcer: Well, the abs are fab and it’s gluteus to the maximus here at tonight’s Far, Far Away Royal Ball Blowout! The coaches are lined up as the cream of the crop pours out of them like Miss Muffet’s curds and whey!


[Joan Rivers talks to the camera with loudspeaker in hand]

Joan: Everyone who’s anyone has turned out to honor Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek and, oh my, the outfits look gorgeous! Look! Hansel and Gretel!

[Hansel and Gretel skip down the carpet hand in hand, tossing bread crumbs along their path]

Joan: What the heck are the crumbs for? And right behind them, Tom Thumb and Thumbelina! Oh, aren’t they adorable!

[The tiny Tom Thumb and Thumbelina are mistakenly swept up by a man sweeping the crumbs]

Joan: Here comes Sleeping Beauty!

[The carriage door is opened and Sleeping Beauty falls onto the carpet, still sleeping]

Joan: Oh, tired old thing...who’s this? Who’s this?! Who is this?

[Fairy Godmother's pink carriage descends]

Joan: Oh. It’s the one, it’s the only…it’s the Fairy Godmother!

[Fairy Godmother hovers her way across the red carpet]

Fairy Godmother: Hello, Far Far Away! Can I get a "whoop-whoop"?

[The crowd whoops]

Fairy Godmother: May all your endings be happy and…well, you know the rest!

INT. - THE SWAMP. SHREK'S HOME.

[Pinocchio, Gingy, Big Bad Wolf, the Three Little Pigs, and the Three Blind Mice are using the Magic Mirror as a TV. They are watching footage of the event as it cuts to a commercial break]

Magic Mirror: We’ll be right back with the Royal Far Far Away Ball after these messages.

Gingy: I hate these ball shows! They bore me to tears. Flip over to Wheel Of Torture.

Pinocchio: I’m not flipping anywhere, sir, until I see Shrek and Fiona.

Gingy: Whizzes on you guys! Hey, mice, pass me a buffalo wing.

[The mice start moving their canes around, unaware that the plate of chicken wings is right next to them]

Gingy: No no, to your left. Your left!

[A chicken wing flies up and lands inside the rancid fish bowl]

Magic Mirror: Tonight on "K.N.I.G.H.T.S."…

Gingy: Ah! Now here’s a good show!

[Footage plays of Shrek, Donkey, and Puss in Boots being chased by several patrols of knights]

Knight: We got a white bronco heading east into the forest. Requesting backup.

Narrator: It's time for the men in steel to teach these madcap mammals their "devil may mare" attitudes just won't fly!

[The chase ends in the streets of Far Far Away. Two knights seize Shrek and three more point their crossbows at him]

Shrek: Alright, alright! Let me go!

[Three knights are restraining Donkey]

Donkey: Let me go!! Why are you grabbing me?! OW!! Police brutality!!! POLICE BRUTALITY!!!!!

Knight: Come on!

Shrek: I have to talk to Princess Fiona!

Knight: We warned you!

[A knight runs up to Shrek with pepper shaker and sprays it into his eyes]

Shrek: Ow! Ow!

Narrator: Will they get away with it? Or did someone let the cat out of the bag?

Puss in Boots: You capitalist pig dogs!

[Puss in Boots pounces on a knight who grabs him. Two knights restrain him with an animal capture device and one lifts a dime bag off of him. He sniffs it and shows the camera]

Knight: Catnip!

Puss in Boots: That’s, uh, not mine.

[The knights proceed to throw Shrek, Donkey, and Puss in Boots into the back of a metal wagon]

Shrek: Hold on! Alright! Find Princess Fiona!

Donkey: I’m a donkey!

[The knights shut the doors of the van. Shrek yells through the bars of the door]

Shrek: Tell her, Shrek--I’m her husband, Shrek! Ow!

[The show freezes frame on Shrek's face as a knight sprays him with a pepper shaker again]

Narrator: K.N.I.G.H.T.S.!

Gingy: Quick! Rewind it!

[The Magic Mirror rewinds the footage]

Shrek: Shrek--I’m her husband, Shrek! Ow!

[The playback stops. Everyone on the couch sits with their mouths wide open]

INT. - FAR FAR AWAY PALACE. NIGHT.

[King Harold is pouring tea into two cups on a tray. He reluctantly pours the contents of the Love Potion into one of the cups. Out from the cup comes a magical dust in the shape of heart, which then dissipates. He pushes open a door, carrying the tray of tea, and sees Fiona staring out of a window]

King Harold: Darling? Ah. I thought I might find you here. How about a nice hot cup of tea before the ball?

Fiona: (sighs) I’m not going.

King Harold: But, but, but the...the whole kingdom’s turned out to celebrate your marriage.

Fiona: There’s just one problem. That’s not my husband. I mean, look at him.

[Fiona gestures out the window at Prince Charming on the red carpet, who is playing up to the crowd]

King Harold: Yes, he is a bit...different, but people change for the ones they love. You’d be surprised how much I changed for your mother.

[King Harold sets the tray down on the window sill]

Fiona: Change? He’s completely lost his mind!

King Harold: Darling, why not come down to the ball and give him another chance? I mean, you might find you like this new Shrek.

Fiona: But it’s the old one I fell in love with, Dad. I’d give anything to have him back.

[Fiona reaches for one of the tea cups, but King Harold quickly grabs it instead]

King Harold: Uh, darling. That’s mine. Decaf. O-otherwise I’m up all night.

[Fiona takes a sip from the other cup and smiles]

Fiona: Thanks.

[King Harold smiles back but looks distressed]

INT. - JAIL TOWER. NIGHT.

[A bridge from the main land connects to an island. On the island is a massive, stone prison with a giant tower. Shrek, Donkey, and Puss in Boots are in a prison cell. Chains dangle from the ceiling which attach to their shackles, keeping them suspended above the floor]

Donkey: I gotta get out of here! You can’t lock us up like this! Let me go! Hey, what about my Miranda Rights? You’re supposed to say, I have the right to remain silent! Nobody said I have the right to remain silent!

Shrek: Donkey, you have the right to remain silent! What you lack is the capacity!

Puss in Boots: I must hold on before I, too, go totally mad.

Pinocchio: Shrek? Donkey?

[Staring down from above through a grate is Pinocchio, Ginny, Big Bad Wolf, the Three Little Pigs, and the Three Blind Mice]

Puss in Boots: Too late.

Shrek: Gingy! Pinocchio! Get us out of here!

[Dynamite sticks are rigged to the grate. One of the mice carries the match to light the fuse, but falls through the grate]

Blind Mouse: Oh…

[The mouse lands with a thud. The Three Little Pigs shake their heads and light the match themselves]

Little Pig: Fire in ze hole!

[The dynamites' explosion blows off the grate. Pinocchio, with key in hand, jumps and the pigs lowers down by his strings. Pinocchio tangles himself up in his strings after flipping and posing on the way down. Gingy groans and slides down the string]

Gingy: Look out below!

Shrek: Quick! Tell a lie!

Pinocchio: What should I say?

Gingy: Anything, but quick!

Donkey: Say something crazy like "I’m wearing ladies’ underwear!"

Pinocchio: I'm...I am wearing ladies’ underwear.

[They wait for Pinocchio's nose to grow but nothing happens]

Shrek: Heh...are you?

Pinocchio: I most certainly am not!

[His nose grows a bit]

Donkey: It looks like you most certainly am are!

Pinocchio: I am not!

[His nose grows even further]

Puss in Boots: What kind?

Gingy: It’s a thong!

[Gingy pulls at his pink thong and lets it slap back]

Pinocchio: Ow! They’re briefs!

[Gingy takes the key and runs across Pinocchio's nose as it continues to grow with each lie]

Gingy: Are not!

Pinocchio: Are too!

Gingy: Are not!

Pinocchio: Are too!

[Gingy eventually reaches Shrek and uses the key to free Shrek, Donkey, and Puss in Boots]

Gingy: Here we go. Hang tight!

Donkey: Wait, wait, wait! Ow! Ow! Hey, hey, hey! Ow!

[The three are dropped down onto the floor of the cell. Shrek looks out the window, seeing the Far Far Away Palace. Shrek hears a muffled voice]

Blind Mouse: Excuse me?

Shrek: What? Puss!

[He sees the mouse's tail sticking out from Puss in Boots' mouth]

Blind Mouse: Pardon me, would you mind letting me go?

[Puss in Boots spits out the mouse]

Puss in Boots: Sorry, boss.

Shrek: Quit messing around! We’ve got to stop that kiss!

Donkey: I thought you was going to let her go.

Shrek: I was, but I can’t let them do this to Fiona!

Donkey: Boom! That’s what I like to hear. Look who’s finally coming around!

Puss in Boots: But it’s impossible! We’ll never get in. The castle is guarded and there is a moat and everything!

Gingy: Well, folks, it looks like we’re up chocolate creek without a popsicle stick.

[Shrek stares thoughtfully at Gingy]

Gingy: What?

Shrek: Do you still know the Muffin Man?

Gingy: Well, sure! He’s down on Drury Lane. Why?

Shrek: Because we’re gonna need flour. Lots and lots of flour.

EXT. - DRURY LANE. NIGHT.

[Shrek knocks on the front door of a bakery. The Muffin Man opens the door and happily greets Gingy, who is standing on Shrek's shoulder]

Muffin Man: Gingy!

Gingy: Fire up the ovens, Muffin Man! We’ve got a big order to fill!

[An evil chuckle is heard from inside the bakery as lightning strikes in the sky]

Gingy: It’s alive!

CITY OF FAR FAR AWAY. NIGHT.

[A couple is out on a table drinking tea when their cups begin to shake. In the city, palm trees not too far off fall down one after the other. Donkey comes chasing through with Puss, Pinocchio, Big Bad Wolf, the Pigs, and the Mice on his back]

Donkey: Run, run, run, as fast you can!

[Citizens of the kingdom scream as the feet of a giant gingerbread man stomp through the streets. His name is Mongo, and Shrek and Gingy are riding on his shoulders]

Gingy: Go, baby, go!

Shrek: There it is, Mongo! To the castle!

[Shrek points towards the Far Far Away Palace. Mongo instead grabs a giant coffee mug on top of a Farbucks Coffee building]

Shrek: No, no, no, no, you great stupid pastry! Come on!

[Customers come running out of the building. Mongo tries to drink from the giant cup, but drops it after nothing comes out of it]

Donkey: Mongo! Down here! Look at the pony!

[Mongo starts to laugh and follow Donkey]

Donkey: That’s right! Follow the pretty pony! Pretty pony wants to play at the castle!

Mongo: Oooh, pretty pony.

EXT. - FAR FAR AWAY PALACE. COURTYARD.

[King Harold walks with Fiona in arm and gives her off to Prince Charming. An audience gathered out on the ballroom floor cheers as Charming waves]

Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen! Presenting Princess Fiona and her new husband, Prince Shrek!

[The crowd applauds and Queen Lillian claps along. Fiona has her hand on Prince Charming's arm as they walk down the steps. Prince Charming continues to wave and blow kisses]

Fiona: Shrek, what are you doing?

Prince Charming: I’m just playing the part, Fiona.

Fiona: Is that glitter on your lips?

Prince Charming: Mmm, cherry flavored. Want a taste?

Fiona: Ugh! What is with you?

[Fiona lets go and starts to walk back up the stairs]

Prince Charming: But, Muffin Cake…

[Prince Charming shrugs at Fairy Godmother, who is across the room and by the stage. She goes over to the piano player snapping her fingers]

Fairy Godmother: C minor, put it in C minor.

[Fairy Godmother addresses the crowd and conjures herself a flashy, red dress]

Fairy Godmother: Ladies and gentlemen. I’d like to dedicate this song to…Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek.

[A spotlight shines on the two and Fiona stops to look back]

Prince Charming: Fiona, my Princess. Will you honor me with a dance?

[Fiona looks hesitantly at Prince Charming and then back at Fairy Godmother. She starts singing "Holding Out for a Hero"]

Fairy Godmother: Where have all the good men gone / And where are all the gods?

[Fairy Godmother continutes to sing. Fiona looks uncomfortably at the crowd who are all chanting "Dance! Dance!" Prince Charming holds out his hand and Fiona eventually takes it. They slowly dance on the ballroom floor]

Fiona: Since when do you dance?

Prince Charming: Fiona, my dearest, if there’s one thing I know, it’s that love is full of surprises.

Fairy Godmother: Late at night I toss and I turn / And I dream of what I need Hit it!

[A band and choir join in and the music kicks into gear]

EXT. - FAR FAR AWAY PALACE. OUTER WALLS.

[Shrek, Mongo, and Gingy approach the walls surrounding the palace. Surrounding the walls is a deep moat and the drawbridge over it has been pulled up. Guards rush around the top of the walls as the Captain of the Guards shouts orders]

Shrek: All right, big fella! Let’s crash this party!

Captain: Man the catapults! Ready! Fire!

[A guard uses a catapult to launch a fireball right at Mongo's chest]

Shrek: Brace yourselves!

Mongo: Ooh! Purty!

[The fireball hits him in the chest and he steps back, nearly stomping on Donkey and the rest of the group]

Gingy: Not the gumdrop button!

[The fireball hit him square in the gumdrop. Mongo watches the gumdrop drop to the ground, still on fire, he gets angry and lets out a Godzilla-esque roar. Mongo kicks the gumdrop back, landing right on top of the catapult and destroying it]

Guard: Incoming!

Donkey: Ha-ha! All right!

EXT. - FAR FAR AWAY PALACE. COURTYARD.

[Prince Charming and Fiona continue to dance, though she is still uncomfortable. Watching on from the side, King Harold is facepalming and Queen Lillian looks at him]

EXT. - FAR FAR AWAY PALACE. OUTER WALLS.

[Mongo is getting closer to the gate but the guards are shooting more fireballs at him]

Shrek: Go, Mongo! Go!

Captain: Man the cauldrons!

[The guards pour hot, bubbling liquid into a set of machinery]

Shrek: After you, Mongo.

[Mongo starts to pull down the drawbridge]

Captain: That’s it! Heave-ho!

[The guards pour down a giant vat of the liquid onto Mongo's head]

Shrek: Watch out!

Donkey: Shrek!

[Mongo rises back up, the foam having formed around his head like a wig]

Guard: More heat, less foam!

EXT. - FAR FAR AWAY PALACE. COURTYARD.

[Fairy Godmother continues to sing. Prince Charming is tossing a rose around his mouth]

EXT. - FAR FAR AWAY PALACE. OUTER WALLS.

[Mongo is trying to pull down the drawbridge again]

Captain: Heave! Ho!

[Shrek looks up as the guards pour down more liquid onto Mongo. This time his arms snap off, still holding open the drawbridge, as the rest of Mongo starts falling back into the moat. Shrek grabs onto one the arms and Gingy jumps back down to Mongo]

Gingy: Nooo!

[Mongo's arms start to crack as the guards try to pull the drawbridge back up. Shrek climbs up and gets through]

EXT. - FAR FAR AWAY PALACE. COURTYARD.

[Prince Charming spits out the rose, scoops Fiona in his arms, and leans in for a kiss. Fiona grabs the rose and puts it in her mouth, stopping him. They continue to dance]

EXT. - FAR FAR AWAY PALACE.

[Shrek swings down the chain to the drawbridge and knocks over the three guards that were pulling on it. He lowers the drawbridge for the rest of the group]

Shrek: [whistles] Come on!

[The group cheers. Meanwhile, Gingy is standing on Mongo's face as he sinks into the water]

Mongo: Be...good.

[Gingy is scooped up by Puss in Boots' sword and into Pinocchio's arms]

Gingy: He needs me! Let me go!

[Shrek and Puss in Boots ride Donkey up the deserted red carpet and toward the front doors of the palace. Suddenly a group of armed guards show up and block the doorway]

Shrek: Donkey!

[Donkey leaps up and over the group of guards and they chase after them. Puss in Boots jumps off and Shrek and Donkey halt]

Shrek: Puss!

Puss in Boots: Go! Go! Your lady needs you! Go!

Shrek and Donkey race off as Puss in Boots turns to face the guards. He takes off his hat and sheathes his sword

Puss in Boots: Today, I repay my debt.

[Puss in Boots puts on his cute, guilty face. The guards stop and lift the visors from the helmets]

Guards: Aww…

Puss in Boots: [growling] En garde!

[Puss in Boots leaps from guard to guard, battling them off with his sword]

EXT. - FAR FAR AWAY PALACE. COURTYARD.

[Prince Charming once again leans Fiona down in his arms and tries to kiss her. This time she doesn't resist. But just as they are about to kiss, Shrek and Donkey come bursting through the doors to the courtyard]

Shrek: STOP!!!

[The music comes to a halt. Donkey hurries down the stairs and Shrek jumps off his back]

Shrek: Hey, you! Back away from my wife!

Fiona: Shrek?

[The crowd gasps. King Harold and Queen Lillian look on, surprised]

Fairy Godmother: You couldn’t just go back to your swamp and leave well enough alone.

Shrek: Now!

[The Three Little Pigs launch one of themselves at Fairy Godmother using a blanket as a slingshot]

Three Little Pigs: Pigs und blanket!

[The pig grabs onto Fairy Godmother's leg and she tries to shake him off. Shrek swings Pinocchio by his strings and throws him at Fairy Godmother]

Shrek: Pinocchio! Get the wand!

Pig #1: I see London! I see France!

Pinocchio: Waaaahhh!

[Pinocchio misses Fairy Godmother and she shoots him with her wand, transforming him into a human boy]

Pinocchio: I’m a real boy!

[Fairy Godmother flings the pig into the open window of some woman. She raises her wand to zap Shrek, but Big Bad Wolf begins blowing her away with his breath. She drops the wand and another pig grabs it and runs. She chases after him]

Pig #2: Catch!

[The pig throws the wand to Donkey]

Gingy: Donkey!

[Donkey throws it to Gingy as Fairy Godmother still tries to grab it. Gingy throws it to the Three Blind Mice who don't catch it. The wand bounces on the ground and activates]

Pinocchio: I’m a real boy. Ah!--

[The wand's magic hits Pinocchio and he turns back into his puppet by itself]

Pinocchio: Oh...

[Shrek and Fairy Godmother chase after the wand]

Fairy Godmother: That’s mine! That’s mine!

[Fairy Godmother grabs it but Shrek swipes it out of her hands and into the air. Donkey races to the wand. Puss in Boots climbs on top of his head and grabs it]

Donkey: Pray for mercy, from Puss...

Puss in Boots: And Donkey!

Fairy Godmother: She’s taken the potion! Kiss her now!

[Prince Charming runs up to Fiona, grabs her shoulders, and kisses her]

Shrek: No!

[Shrek drops to his knees. King Harold and Queen Lillian look on with concern. Fairy Godmother smiles. Fiona looks at Prince Charming with surprise, and then with affection. Prince Charming puts his hand on Fiona's face, and then she holds his face with both hands]

Fiona: Hi-ya!

[Fiona headbutts Prince Charming and he drops to the floor. The crowd gasps. Shrek runs up to Fiona]

Shrek: Fiona.

Fiona: Shrek.

Fairy Godmother: Harold! You were supposed to give her the potion!

King Harold: Well, I guess I gave her the wrong tea.

[Prince Charming grabs the wand from Puss in Boots and throws it to Fairy Godmother]

Prince Charming: Mommy!

Fiona: Mommy?

Fairy Godmother: (growls) I told you!...

[Fairy Godmother flies up into the air, clutching onto the wand. Shrek and Fiona hold onto each other]

Fairy Godmother: Ogres don’t live happily. Ever. AFTER!!!!!!!!!

[Fairy Godmother zaps her wand at Shrek and Fiona. Shrek pushes Fiona out of the way and to the ground. King Harold runs over to them]

Queen Lillian: Harold!

Fiona: Shrek!

King Harold: (yelling) NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

[King Harold leaps in front of Shrek and gets hit by the wand's zap as a horrible sacrifice to the kingdom! King Harold's ceremonial armor chestplate deflects the magical trail back to hit Fairy Godmother. She is knocked back, but appears to be unscathed]

Fairy Godmother: Woo....ha!--

[Fairy Godmother turns into bubbles for her death. Her glasses and wand drop to the ground. Fiona runs over to King Harold's now empty armor and clothes]

Fiona: [gasping] Oh, Dad!

[She sobs and Shrek takes her in his arms. Queen Lillian runs over]

Pinocchio: Is he…?

Gingy: Yup.

[A frog ribbit is heard from inside the chestplate]

Gingy: He croaked.

[A frog comes crawling out from inside the chestplate]

Queen Lillian: Harold?

Fiona: Dad?

King Harold: I’d hoped you’d never see me like this.

Donkey: Hey! And he gave you a hard time!

Shrek: Donkey!

King Harold: No, no, he’s right. I’m sorry. To both of you. I only wanted what was best for Fiona. But I can see now… she already has it. Shrek, Fiona…will you accept an old frog’s apologies… and my blessing?

Queen Lillian: Harold?

King Harold: I’m sorry, Lillian. I just wish I could be the man you deserve.

[King Harold tries to leap away but Queen Lillian catches him]

Queen Lillian: You’re more that man today than you ever were… warts and all.

[King Harold ribbits. The clock chimes]

Puss in Boots: Boss! The Happily Ever After Potion!

Shrek: Midnight! Fiona, is this what you want? To be this way forever?

Fiona: What?

Shrek: Because if you kiss me now, we can stay like this.

Fiona: You’d do that? For me?

Shrek: Yes.

[Fiona looks back at King Harold and Queen Lillian, then back to Shrek

Fiona: I want what any princess wants. To live happily ever after…

[Shrek leans in to kiss Fiona, but she gently stops him with her hand]

Fiona: ...with the ogre I married.

Puss in Boots: Whatever happens, I must not cry! You cannot make me cry!

[Puss in Boots quietly cries and the clock bells ring]

[Shrek and Fiona hold each other's hands as they are engulfed in a magical aura and float into the air. The same happens to Donkey. Donkey begins to transform back into his donkey self]

Donkey: No. No, no. Aaah! Ow. Oh, no.

[He is lowered back to the ground. So are Shrek and Fiona, who are both now ogres. Donkey sighs]

Shrek: [laughs] Hey. You still look like a noble steed to me.

Fiona: [giggles] Now, where were we?

Shrek: Oh. I remember.

[Shrek leans Fiona over and they kiss. The crowd claps]

Puss in Boots: Hey! Isn’t we supposed to be having a fiesta?

[The crowd cheers and Donkey and Puss in Boots take to the stage]

Donkey: Uno, dos, quatro, hit it! Puss and Donkey, y’all…

[Donkey and Puss in Boots start singing "Livin' La Vida Loca" by Ricky Martin. The band accompanies them]

Donkey: She’s into superstitions / Black cats and voodoo dolls...sing it, Puss!

Puss in Boots: I feel a premonition / That girl’s gonna make me fall

Donkey: Here we go!

[The whole crowd is now dancing along]

Puss in Boots: She’s into new sensations / New kicks in the candlelight

Donkey & Puss in Boots: She’s got a new addiction / For every day and night / She’ll make you take your clothes off / And go dancing in the rain / She’ll make you live her crazy life / But she’ll take away your pain / Like a bullet to your brain / Upside inside out / Living la vida loca

[Doris walks up to Prince Charming and tries to kiss him]

Doris: Hey, gorgeous!

[Mongo is still fully submerged under the water]

Mongo: Living la vida loca

Donkey & Puss in Boots: Her lips are devil red / And her skin’s the color of mocha / She will wear you out / Living la vida loca

Donkey: Oh, she livin’ it loca!

Puss in Boots: Living la vida loca

Donkey: Say it one more time now!

Donkey & Puss in Boots: Living la vida loca

Puss in Boots: Hey, Donkey, that’s Spanish!

Donkey & Puss in Boots: She’ll push and pull you down / Living la vida loca / She will wear you out / Living la vida loca / Living la vida loca / She’ll push and pull you down / Living la vida loca / Her lips are devil red / And her skin’s the color of mocha / She will wear you out / Living la vida loca / Living la vida loca / Living la vida loca / Living la vida loca

[The song ends and the end credits roll. The dance floor is empty, except for Shrek and Fiona still slow dancing. Donkey sits on the stage quietly singing]

Donkey: All by myself / Don’t wanna be / All by myself anymore…

[Puss in Boots walks up with two women by his side]

Puss in Boots: Amigo, we are off to the Kit-Kat Club. Come on, join us.

Donkey: Thanks, compadre. I’m… I’m not in the mood.

Puss in Boots: We will cheer you up! Find you a nice....uh, burro!

[Dragon roars. Donkey looks up into the sky]

Donkey: Hey, baby! Woo! Hey, that’s my girl! Yeah! All right!

[Dragon lands on the dance floor]

Donkey: Baby, where you been?

Dragon: [whimpers]

Donkey: I’m sorry, too. I should’ve stayed. But Shrek had this thing he had to do and uh--

Dragon: [groans]

Donkey: What? Say it one more time. What you talking about? Are you serious?!

[In comes flying a small donkey with the wings, scales, and fiery breath of a dragon]

Dronkey: Da-da!

[5 more of the dronkeys come flying in and jump all over Donkey. Dragon blows a cloud in the shape of a heart]

Donkey: Look at our little mutant babies! I got to get a job.
